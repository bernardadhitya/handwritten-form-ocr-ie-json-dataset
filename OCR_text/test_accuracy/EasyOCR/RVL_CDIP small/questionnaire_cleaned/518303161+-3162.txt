Dear Valued Customer:
Recently you contacted R. J. Reynolds'Consumer Relations Department and gave
us the opportunity to respond to your request for assistance with either a promotion
or product related issue.
In an effort to better serve our customers, we are asking you to please take a few
minutes to complete a questionnaire about how well you were treated by our
company representative. After completing the survey on the reverse side of this
letter, please return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.
Thank you for taking the time to let us know how our staff met your expectations.
We value your opinion and appreciate your business.
