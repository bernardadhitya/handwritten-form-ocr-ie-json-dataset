Abstract:
This paper will review the historical development of our understanding of the chemistry and physics
of cigarette smoke since the first Tobacco Chemists 
Research Confercnce_
We will begin by
recreating the state of knowledge in the mid-[940'
Then, emphasizing the contribution of TCRC,
the critica
papers and reviews will be cited to show how our
understanding of smoke formation and
behavior has progressed. Special attention will be
to the value and pitfalls of pyrolysis
experiments. aerosol properties, and the shift frorn
smoke formation concepts to detailed
explanations on the micro
processes and environmenis occurring in
cigarette_
