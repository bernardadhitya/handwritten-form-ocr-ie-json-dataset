PROPOSAL:
To reduce the complexity of the ingredients used in the filter flavors for all RJRT
cigarette brands other than SALEM Slim Light 100MORE Light Menthol 100 and VANTAGE 100.
This change involves removing ingredients which represent 35 parts per billion of the
cigarette weight (Attachment 1). Extensive testing on Discrimination, Descriptive and
U.S. Mail panels showed no significant difference in the flavor of the brands tested
see Attachment 2). Non-menthol cigarettes in all tar ranges were evaluated as they were
configurations in which changes were most likely to be evident.
OBJECTIVES:
1)
To remove four unnecessary flavor components from RJRT filter flavors, and
2) To eliminate two problem compounds from RJRT flavor inventory.
The cost impact in terms of raw material cost is insignificant, a savings of
$1000/year.
