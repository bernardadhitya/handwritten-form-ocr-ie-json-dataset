You have killed my love.
You used to stir my imagination.
Now you don 't
even stir my
curiosity.  You simply produce no effect.
I loved you because you
were marvellous. because
you had genius and intellect ,
because
realised the dreams of great poets and
gave
shape and substance to the shadows of art.
You have thrown it all away:
You are shallow
and stupid.
