Imagine
a
vast  sheet of paper
on
which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons,
Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about,
on
or in

without
the power of
above
or
sinking below
it,
very
much like shadows
only hard and with luminous edges
and you will then have a pretty
correct
notion of my country and countrymen_
Alas.
a
few years ag0
1 should have said
universe
but now my mind has been opened t0 higher views of things:
