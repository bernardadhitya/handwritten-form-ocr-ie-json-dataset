4-7
You
have killed my love.
You used to stir my imagination:
Now you don 't even
stir my
curiosity. You simply produce no effect.
I loved you because you were marvellous_
because
you had genius and intellect, because
you realised the dreams of great poets and gave
shape and substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away:
You are shallow
and stupid.
