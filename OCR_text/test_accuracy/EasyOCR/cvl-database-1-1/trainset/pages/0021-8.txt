21-8
While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened
there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind
the entire orb of the satellite burst at once UpOn my sight
my brain reeled as
1
saw the
mighty walls rushing asunder
there was a
tumultuous shouting sound like the voice
of a thousand waters
and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently
over the
fragments of the "House of Usher.
