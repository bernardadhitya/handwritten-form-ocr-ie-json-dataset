You have killed my love.
You used to stir my imagination: Now you don t
even stir my
curiosity.
You simply produce no effeet.
I loved you because you were marvellous, because
you
had genius and intellect ,
because
you realised the dreams of great
and gave
shape and substance to the shadows of art.
You have thrown it all away:
You are shallow
and stupid
You  Ave
