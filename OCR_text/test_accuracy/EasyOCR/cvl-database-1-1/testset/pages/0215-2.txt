And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
Anel Jorhun, en his clamneel quaul smilinq,
Show'el lik A wbel'o whou buf all's sso weak-
Lot lowx Nemoeo-well h clesewes Nhal nami-
Diselaining hothin, wilh his branelish'd slell,
Which smokeel wifh blwcoly euculIn,
Like valow`o mnicn cawed euf his paoaqe
Till hi face th olau;.
