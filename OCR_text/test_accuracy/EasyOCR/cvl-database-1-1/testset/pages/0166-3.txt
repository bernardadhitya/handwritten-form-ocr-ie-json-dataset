Mailiifterl is an Austrian nickname for the first computer working solely on transistors on
the European mainland. It was built in 1955 at the Vienna University of Technology by
Heinz Zemanek   The builder plays on
a
quote on
an
operating computer:
If it is not the
rapid calculation
of American models that Whirlwind
or
Typhoon can achieve, it
will be enough for a Wiener Mailifterl"
The full name is Binar dezimaler Volltransistor-
Rechenautomat.
