Imagine
a
vast sheet of paper
on
which straight  Lines,  Triangles,  Squares   Pentagons,
Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about,
on
or  in the surface,
but  without the power of
above
or
sinking below it,
very
much like shadows
only hard and with luminous
and you will then have a pretty
correct notion of my country and countrymen.
Alas, & few years ag0, I should have said
universe"
but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.
