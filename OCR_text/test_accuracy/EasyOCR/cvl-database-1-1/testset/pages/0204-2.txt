And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And Qortune ion his damned quarrel shiling J
Show'd lihe a rebel's whore: but ql's too.
Weak: For brqve Nomacs,vell he deseves thqt nane.
Disdqining Dortune, uith his br9ndish'd steel,.
Uhich smoked wih Yloody execution,.
Like vq|our's Mnion cQrved out his p9ssqpe
Till he Aqced the s|qve;.
