Imagine a
vast sheet of paper
on
which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons,
Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about,

or
sinking below it,
very
much like shadows
only hard and with luminous edges
and you will then have a pretty
correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, & few years ag0, I should have said
universe'
but now my mind has been opened to higher views of
