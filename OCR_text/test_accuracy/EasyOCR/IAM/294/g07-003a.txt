His only reference
to Trelawny by
name in the
course of several communications to
Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is satirical:
'I have not
the lhonor of
any
acquaintance with Mr Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when
Count Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante_
If Trelawny
failed
even
to meet Lord Sidney and the British Government's other representatives
in the islands, while they warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far
to explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young Italian's expense.
