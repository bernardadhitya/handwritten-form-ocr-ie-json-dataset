Background >? °?

Project RP was initiated in 1985 as a New Brands project which
combined R&D's technologies into a product offering smokers a
personal as well as a social acceptability benefit. The RP
technology combines a patented, magnesium hydroxide cigarette
paper, a special filtration system and the "RAN" blend (83%
puffed flued cured tobacco, 178 Turkish tobacco) to produce the
following benefits: 7

Less sidestream smoke

Low gas phase elementsin mainstream smoke

Low biological activity

Reduction in the amount of total smoke

(burns less tobacco and therefore less total smoke)
(See Exhibit A for espective benefits)

Based upon the aforementioned benefits, potential advertising
claims include the following:

[in August, 1988, VANTAGE will be introducing the RP technology in

test market on 2 styles, an 85MM and 100MM FFLT NM. The VANTAGE
RP (Project VRP) product is white-tipped, has a standard estron
filter and has 9mg of tar. VRP Development work was also
conducted on a FFLT Menthol 100MM style until 4th Quarter, 1987.
To complete the required substantiation tests and introduce by
August, 1988, a decision was made by Senior Management to limit
vrP's introduction to the two nonmenthol styles.
