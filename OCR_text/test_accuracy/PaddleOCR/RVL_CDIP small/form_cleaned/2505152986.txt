Dear Dr.Schepers
Please find the attached abstract and what little additional information was on
Hecht's poster at the last AACR Meeting in San Diego
I have several problems accepting Hecht's proposed results and metabolic
scheme - can we get together sometime at INBlFO before the end of the month
to discuss the issue?
Best regards,
