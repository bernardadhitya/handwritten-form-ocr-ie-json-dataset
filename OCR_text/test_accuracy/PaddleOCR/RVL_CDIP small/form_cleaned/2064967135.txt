Hi Laure,
Here are the responses to the e:mail guestions:
Atte hed is the reorganized activity list for both ranches.Please note if a waiver is nct required, it is
coved in the guest's affidavit or either the KMG or Ranch waiver.
Roud House ls the company where we rent all of our downhi including snowboard equipment They
waivers like Bridger-the lift ticket is one, the ski school is another. We will also contract a vendor like
Rond House)for rental equipment whlch would represent another waiver.
I've attached two waivers we used at Deadrock this past January-one is the ranch's and ce is ours. The
Kiv. one refers to Hospitality Consultantswhich represents the guests we handlec.This wi be
 fied for the consumer trips. Only 320 Ranch and White Stallion use one page waivers.The altached
Desdrock waiver is now used year around.
an attaching a.Yellowstone Snowmoble waiver as we as their rules and regulatons, for your
info.matian.
Sore waivers would need to be different at 320-the ranchwaiver and all the Big St skiing-related
waivers.The KMG waiver would need to be modified.
Piease lat me know if you are in need of any additional information
