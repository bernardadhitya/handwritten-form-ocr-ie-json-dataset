2-8
While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened
there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind
the entire orb of the satellite burst at
once upon
my sight
my brain reeled
as
[
saw the
mighty walls rushing asunder
there was a
tumultuous shouting sound like the voice
of a thousand waters
and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently
over the fragments of the "House of Usher.'
