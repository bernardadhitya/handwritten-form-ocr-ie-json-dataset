And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish’d steel, ,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour’s minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;

Ard fork, on bis dovrneel fucocttl Su long,
Shou dl Che a pele phere Bid AE fos oak’
Tor Lave Soha s — etl he AMdUVe Lot Land —

Lke jalews-s prmohk caved at fat ppavege
Tal he paced 4h lave .
