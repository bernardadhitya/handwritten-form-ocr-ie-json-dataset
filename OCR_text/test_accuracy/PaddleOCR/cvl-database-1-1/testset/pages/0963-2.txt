And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling.
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,

Like valour’s minion carved out his passage

Till he faced the slave;

Aol fovtene, on lus dau nel quevre| Suci ling,
Show'd (ile @ vebel's ybove> bul gll’s too weaks

Dis leaving fortewe, wills ig rowbich slee(

Which suroleel wilk bledlly creacheor

Lite va louv's Wiener covvel el lis pa srege
