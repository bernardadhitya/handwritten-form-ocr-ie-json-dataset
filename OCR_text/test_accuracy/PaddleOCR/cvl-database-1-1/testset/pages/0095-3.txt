Mailiifterl is an Austrian nickname for the first computer working solely on transistors on
the European mainland. It
was built in 1955 at the Vienna University of Technology by
Heinz Zemanek.
The builder plays on a quote on
an
operating computer:
If it is not the
calculation
of American models that Whirlwind
or
Typhoon can achieve, it
will be enough for a Wiener Mailiifterl"_
The full name is Binar dezimaler Volltransistor-
Rechenautomat_
