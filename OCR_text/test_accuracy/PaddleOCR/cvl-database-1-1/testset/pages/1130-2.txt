And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,

Like valour’s minion carved out his passage

Till he faced the slave;

Ad be fotac, ee heved gear scl,
She'd Lhe a rblo Aove b4 alli to veal:
For hice Moone ce cll be Aserves i
Dschrsig Core oil bir bw dld hel, Ace.
