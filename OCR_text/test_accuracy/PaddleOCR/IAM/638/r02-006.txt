At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake had claimed tax relief on the purchase of sev-

eral mink coats which, it seemed, were necessary to further her career. Alternatively,

and therefore susceptible to a depreciation tax allowance as plant and machinery. The
Commissioners of Inland Revenue wisely refrained from asking how she paid for the
mink coats but demanded a receipt instead.
