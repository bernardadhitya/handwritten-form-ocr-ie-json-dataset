But there is heart in the telling, and an intense realism in the situation. A young
girl lives in a single dingy room with her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
surroundings she learns sex is something sordid, and when she experiences it for the
first time herself it is incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and half inquisitively. As
is the case in Fanny her first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear his child and sails
away.
