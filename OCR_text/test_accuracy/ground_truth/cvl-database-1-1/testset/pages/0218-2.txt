And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And fovrune,on hin damned quorvel smieip.
