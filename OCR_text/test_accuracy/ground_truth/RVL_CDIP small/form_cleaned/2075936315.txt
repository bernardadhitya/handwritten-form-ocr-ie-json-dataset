Abstract:
This paper will review the historical development of our understanding of the chemistry and physics
of cigarette smoke since the first Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference. We will begin by
recreating the state of knowledge in the mid-1940's. Then, emphasizing the contribution of TCRC,
the critical papers and reviews will be cited to show how our understanding of smoke formation and
behavior has progressed. Special attention will be paid to the value and pitfalls of pyrolysis
experiments, aerosol properties, and the shift from global smoke formation concepts to detailed
explanations on the micro-processes and environments occurring in a cigarette.
