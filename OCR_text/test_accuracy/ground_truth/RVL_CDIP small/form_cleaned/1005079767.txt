The maxisal treadmill exercise responses of approximately 900 clinically normal males
betveen 25.and 55 years of age will be studied to determine if there are any significant
differences between cigarette smokers and non-smokers..
The parameters to be compared
between.the two groups are:
1.
Maxieal heart rate.
Duration of maximal exercise.
2.
3.
Systolic blood pressure during maximal exercise testing.
4.
Incidence of arrhythmias during maximal exercise testing.
5
Differences in the computer quantitated changes in the ST segment
slope and depression in response to maximal exercise.
