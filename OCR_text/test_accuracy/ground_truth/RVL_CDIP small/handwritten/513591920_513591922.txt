We are delighted with your interest in our Camel ad
campaign.
Unfortunately, all of the "smooth moves" we are going
to be using for the current campaign have already been
produced to be issued in the marketplace.
As a token of our appreciation for taking the time to
write, we are enclosing a few coupons for you to use.
toward your next carton purchases.
Best wishes from all of us here at R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company.
Sincerely,
JoarI. Cockerham
