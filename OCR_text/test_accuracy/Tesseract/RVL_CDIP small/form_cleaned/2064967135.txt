are located at Bridger Bow (tho Independent ofthe area), have great equipment, prices and sarvice)

° We do not have a Big Sky waiver sinca we've never had a program or guest go there. They would have
waivers like Bridger — the lift ticket is one, the ski school is another, We will also contract a vendor (ike

Rov nd House) for rental equipment, which would represent another waive.
Deadrock this past January ~ one's the ranch’s and ce fs ours. The

Cor ’s", which represents the guests we handle. This wil bo
‘and Whita Station use one page waivers. The attached

  
 
 

ble waiver, a5 well as their rules and regulations, for your

Sore walvers would need to be different at 220 — the ranch waiver and all the Big Sty’ sking-elated
