Abstract
Chemituminescence detection of nitric oxide, using the Sievers Model 280 NOA™ Nitric Oxide Analyzer, has

 

been used successfully for the analysis of nitrate, nitrite, and nitroso-containing compounds (including tobscco-
specific N-nitrosamines) in tobacco in the parts-per-billion range, Treating aqueous tobacco extracts with
‘vanadium (II} chloride in acid quantitatively produces nitric oxide from nitrate and nitrite). Similarly, treatment
‘ith potassium iodide quantitatively reduces nitite, but not nitrate, to nitic oxide. Group analysis of compounds
containing the nitroso group can also be achieved by the same technique. ‘To do so, tobacco extracts were treated
‘with cuprous chloride in acid to release nitic oxide from nitroso-containing compounds, including N-nitrosamines.
‘The mechenism of that reaction, the relative reactivities of various nitrosamines towards the reagent, and the

climination of interference of nitrate and itrite tothe analysis will be described and discussed.
