Re.:. Invoice Project P3216, your fax of 20 July 1995,

Dear Mr. Jakins:

We agree to your proposal to deduct £ 1,409.00 from your invoice # 118842 of 14 June
1995, due to inadequate slide qualiy in 40% of the larynx slides. Since we cannot use
these slides for evaluation purposes, we would like to point out that the actual damage
incurred is many times higher than your discount.

 

It there is to be possible future collaboration we will have to find ways to ensure reliable
quality,

Sincerely yours,

“t-)
