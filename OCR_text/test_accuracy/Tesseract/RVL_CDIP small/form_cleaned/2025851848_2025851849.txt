PROCLAMATION
OF THE COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC HEALTH
FOR THE STATE (CITY, TOWN) OF

 

 

A CALL FOR
ALL VICTIMS OF CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO INDUCED: DISEASE
10 INITIATE
PERSONAL INJURY/PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS
AGAINST THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY,

FOR THE PROTECTION OF ALL CITIZENS AGAINST THE MOST LETHAL EPIDEMIC
OF DISEASE, DEATH AND DISABILITY IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.

1§ Whereas epidemic cigarette and tobacco-induced disease

causes 350,000 preventable American deaths a year and is the

number one cause of premature death in the State (City, Town) of
and the Nation,

2§ Whereas cigarettes cause heart attacks and heart failure,
emphysema and chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchitis,
Pmeumonia and upper respiratory infections as well as addiction,
fetal injury, burn injury, allergic reactions, stroke, peripheral
vascular disease, and cancers of the mouth, lips, tongue,

larynx, lungs, pancreas, esophagus, bladder and other organs,
resulting in the deaths of 350,000 Americans each year, leaving
millions of others sick and disabled,

3§ Whereas prevention is the best and the least expensive
medicine, and lethal epidemic agents such as tobacco require
strong measures to protect the general population,

4§ Whereas current educational and regulatory measures to curb,
contain and eliminate tobacco and cigarette-diseases have failed

5§ Whereas proper legislative remedies are thwarted by the
immense lobbying power of the tobacco industry and the
self-censorship of much of the news media due to economic
pressure from tobacco advertisers,

6§ Whereas product liability/ personal injury lawsuits are an
established, legal, efficacious and appropriate means to curb the
manufacture and sale of unreasonably dangerous and toxic products.

7§ Whereas cigarettes and tobacco products are addictive and
contain substances which in normal use are highly dangerous and
cause epidemic disease, death, and disability and therefore may
be characterized as unreasonably unsafe and irresponsibly
marketed products,
