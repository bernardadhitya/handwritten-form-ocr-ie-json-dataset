Name: City _flelidler
Smoker Group(s): pe

I work for a company that is conducting a survey for one of our clients. The surveys from this
city and others we've visited will be combined and reported back to our client. From time to
time one of my colleagues may come in during our interview to sit in or clarify something, or
may observe behind a one-way mirror.

‘We'll be asking you to share some information with us about who you are, things you like to do,
how you shop, what brands you're loyal to, and a lot of other questions, just to help us
understand more about you. Many of these questions will be general in nature and some will be
specific to smoking and cigarettes. We are even going to ask you to try a couple of cigarettes
and ask you to give us your honest feedback,

1 will be writing down your answers as we go, so please bear with me if I'm a little slow.
