4. Is KI solution discarded when it turns yellow?

6. Are reagents within their indicated shelf lives?
7. Is sample volune 200 m1 (for chlorine residual
up to 2 mg/1) or 100 ml or proportionately less

8. Is at least 1 ml KI solution added?
Q. . Is at least 1 ml acetate buffer added after KI solution?

10. Is titrant added in progressively smaller
increments until all needle movement ceases?

Is last increment of titrant that causes no
needle response subtracted from final volume?

2. Is the sample value calculated correctly?

(TRC (mg/1) = A_x 200 where A = ml PAO used)?
