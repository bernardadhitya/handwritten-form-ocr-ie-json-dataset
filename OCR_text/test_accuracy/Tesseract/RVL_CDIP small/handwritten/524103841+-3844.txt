minutes to complete a questionnaire about how well you were treated by our
‘company representative. After completing the survey on the reverse side of this
letter, please retum it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

  

Thank you for taking the time to let us know how our staff met your expectations
We value your opinion and appreciate your business.
