Some development corporations have sought to attract private investors by leasing
part of the shopping area to companies experienced in commercial development who
have undertaken the building and letting of the shops. But corporations have generally
found it more satisfactory to build themselves, leasing the shops direct to traders, with
breaks in the lease to enable rents to be increased in scale with the rising prosperity
of the town.
