while she wanted to do no more than run upstairs to her room, knowing that Gavin
although he had told her that he loved her, was already flirting with a girl that he
had only met a few minutes before. Larry’s advice flashed through her mind, but
she turned away, giving a little gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her pride would
never allow her to look the other way and aware too, that her love for Gavin had
already lessened, although she was suffering the pangs of jealousy.
