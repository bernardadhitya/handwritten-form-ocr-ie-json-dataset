And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,

Like valour’s minion carved out his passage

Till he faced the slave;

Shrek forkume cr han damaged quarrel rmting,
Shes A Deke anubel y chore GA prc weak ’

For berger Mamacr - ell hi deere ret meme -
Dirclarning forkens, 0M bin krandinhiel etl,
Aube walour > mugen cerned duh her ganage
THe he faced Abe aise |
