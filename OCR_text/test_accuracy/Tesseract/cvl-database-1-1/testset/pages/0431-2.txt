And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling.
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:

Like valour’s minion carved out his passage

Qrow'd lhe a rebel's whore: hut all's too weak .
For brave Nomack~ wil he deserves that name ~
Dis daining fortune, with his brandish ‘Ah stecl,
Whith smoked wrth Elootly exe ction,

olife valour's minion carved cut his pessape
Wll he taced the slave ;
