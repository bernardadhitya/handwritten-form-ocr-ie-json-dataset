And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show’d like a rebel’s whore: but all’s too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,

Like valour’s minion carved out his passage

Till he faced the slave;

 

And Pockere, on Wy damned aquerrel emis,
Showd Lite ao rebel’, wWhece* but aL ‘g boo ~eak?
Fer brave WVamacs - nell he dereyven Heh nor -
Vis darnmg  Pocune, ith his beondish'd ctecl |
whith ceoked uit bloody x ecukon,

Lyi lee vu odour ‘S$ wminiom carved oot his Gers €
