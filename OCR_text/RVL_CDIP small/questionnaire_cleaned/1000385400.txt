Dear Panelist:
With this ballot I am enclosing ten packs of cigarettes coded as follows:
Q9-2 packs.
Saoke the cigarettes in the order listed on the ballot.
Smoke as many of the 2 packs of each code as you need to make up your mind
and then mark an X in one of the boxes for each scale of each cigarette.
Then smoke the next set of packs rate them and so on. After each pair of
cigarettes, compare the two cigarettes and rate them on the scale provided.
Remember, if the box on the left describes the cigarette better, mark an X
closer to the left. If the box on the right is a better description mark
an x closer to the right.
