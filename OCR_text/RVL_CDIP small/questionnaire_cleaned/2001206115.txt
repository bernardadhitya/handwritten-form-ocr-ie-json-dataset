SURVEY QUEST.IONNAIRE
What types of information would your study group like
to obtain from other groups? What particular areas of
interest would your group need additional information
on, in order to carry out its work successfully?
Information on what the Smoke and Technology are doing where the
raw material imposes limitations on achievement of objectives,
thus.needing either:
a)
treatment modification of the raw material presented, or
b).
modification of cigarette engineering.
We could then determine any possibilities of actually growing the raw
material as desired or for easier subsequent treatment.
Could be quite
radical - do ve need entirely different production techniques?
Maybe it is better business either to modify cigarette specifications to
modify tobacco as presented (for homogeneity of manufactured product) and
that might be a conclusion reached -with field production people
concentrating on saximising productivity within wide physical and
chemical parameters.
These currently grey areas need resolution.
Emphasis at first is to know
more what others have to offer than say what we need to know.
In what rieids and endeavors would cooperation between
the study groups be necessary and mutually beneficial?
could be:
Influence of applied N on smoke nicotine and nitrogen
)oxide smoke yields.
Effect of curing environment on aroma and flavour
Agro/Techno Relationship of botanical structure and culture to
processing properties.
Fungal flora of cured tobacco influence on smoking and
Phyto/Smoke/physical parameters.
Techno:
Effect of field diseases on smoking and physical parameters
