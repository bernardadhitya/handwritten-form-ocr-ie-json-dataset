In this study we are seeking to ascertain brand descriptions that
differentiate between similar brands. We want to learn what makes brands
both similar, and also what makes them not alike.In some cases we know
that the specific product qualities may be primarily responsible while
in other cases it may be the general personality image or emotional
impression that make brands either similar or different.
Our procedure is to match five pairs of brands that are alike within
each pair, and then describe the similarities and differences according to.
the specified questions.
Please give complete and useful reasons that explain exactly how or
what is alike or different. Give the shade of meaning just as any good open
end response must if it's to help give a clear picture.
Since brands come in regular, King and l0omn lengths, and since brands
are menthol, filterand non-filterplease give brand name, type and length
for each mentioned.
