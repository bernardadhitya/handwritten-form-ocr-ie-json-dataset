In the 70's there was a concerted effort both In Canada and the United States to
morbidity and mortality and what are the implications for proposed cigarette
modification programs?
I believe that the reason of the disappointingly small impact on morbidity and
mortality is that most of the consumer acceptable changes had little
substantial impact on the chemical composition of the smoke of the cigarettes.
Our section was involved with the initial characterization of the condensates
and whole smoke from Series I - IV in the Less Hazardous Cigarette Program of
NCI back in the 70's, and there were not many roal differences ln the smokes.
One other factor which complicatod the data analysis was that much of the
bioassay work was performed using cigarette smoke condensates, not whole
smoke. Judging from the composition of the products which were obtained from
Meloy Labs, and our own efforts to gonerate condensate, it was extremely
difficult to generate reproduciblo batches of condensate. I think that added
to some of the scatter ln the mouse skin painting tests. Fairly sophisticated
statistical analysis by ORNL statisticians of tho skln painting study results
indicated that the only thing that seemed to correlate with survival times was
the cross product of nicotine and BAp. So even if we learned a lot about the
effects of changing the tobacco filler on smoke chemistry, frankly, the
changes made in tho smoke were not sufficient to induce a substantial change
in the toxicity/carcinogenicity of the smoke.
Given our present state of knowledge, is it possible to identify specific toxic
cigarette smoke constituents which should be reduced In concentration?
As far as cigarette construction goes, frankly, you need to get away from the
burn anything, even organically grown dried strawberry leaves, you are going
to produce a biologically potent smoke. The Premier clgarette ls an example
of a devlce whlch, if it had been acceptable to consumers, would have really
reduced the toxicity of cigarette smoke. One will still be burning something
to produce the heat needed to vaporize nicotine tand that will produce some CO
and Nox, but the resulting smoke is nowhere near as toxic.
How might reductions be accomplished? Would it be possible to achieve these
reductions in a manner which would be acceptable to smokers?
I believe that if you are going to have traditional cigarettes available at the
same time that you want to have lower toxicity cigarettes available, then you
have got to be able to induce people to switch to these products. That means
advertizing. And it means removal of the bans on implied or explicit health
claims.
Consider low fat foods. Where would they be without the ability to make health
related claims? I realize that the concept of a cigarette brand
really want to do. Do you want to actually increase the consumption of lower
toxicitycigarrettes relatative to conventional ploducts or not? This would
provide an environment which could at least encouraging switching to a less
hazardous product.
Develop a variety of strategles for reduclng smoke toxicity, but keep in mind
inhalation tox studies with cigarettes which have substantially lower toxicity

in the Ames and other tests. Major switching studies wlth large numbers of
subjects that follow the subjects for at least one year. Do they stay switched?
