5.Because smoking among children (especially young children) continues at truly epidemic levels, and many
believe that cigarette advertising is at least partially to blame, other countries have banned tobacco adver
tising.Do you believe the United States should
Ban all tobaccoadvertising
Drastically limit tobacco advertising
Require free space for antismoking messages
Do nothing to restrict general tobacco advertising
6.As mentioned above, smoking costs the public tens of billions of dollars every year in increased health
care costs - most of which are paid by nonsmokers in the form of higher taxes,health insurance
premiums. etc.As a result, do you feel the government should:
Require smokers to pay more for health insurance
Permit insurance companies to charge smokers more
Take no action
Pronbit nsurance companies from charging smokers more
