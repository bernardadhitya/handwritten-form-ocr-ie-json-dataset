Dear Sir:
This is a study of differences in health between non-smokers and
snokers. From tine to time all sorts of claims have been nade as to
the effects of smoking on health.
Kany of these are poorly founded.
We hope to determine statistically the effects of smoking in a group
of nen 50 years of age and over.
Thank you for your cooperation.
