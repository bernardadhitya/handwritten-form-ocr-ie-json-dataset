To Whom It May Concern
I recently purchased a box of Salem Slim Light 100's.1 am writing to you today to inquire about
what I found when I opened the package.
I have smoked this brand for quite a few years. When I opened the box to retrive one of the smokes I
noticed that there was one cigarette that had an emerald green filter. It was the same length as the
others and looked identical except for the filter. I simply am curious as to why this was in there. Am
I the lucky winner of the green filter contest? Is this a quality control issue? Was there a different
Salem brand that does have green filters that was somehow packaged with the Salem Light 100s?
I am wondering how and why this happened and if it is a packaging error then wanted to bring it to
your attention. 1 still do have it. Cigarettes are costly enough-I dont need to get 19 instead of 20
for my money!
I look forward to your reply
Thank you,
