Dear Sirs:
This is to inform you that I was taken to the hospital with only 3% breathing
capacity.There was in deed no oxygenation.
The diagnosis was emphysema after 46 years of smoking your product, which has
been Winston's.
I am very close to dying, in the same manner as my father and grandfather who
were also smokers.At the time we all smoked there were no warnings that
cigarettes contained poisonous compounds of any type.
All the tnformation above has also been mailed to the American Cancer Society and
The Attorney General of Florida.
Duriag my experience in the hospital, I noticed long term smokers dying daily from
smoking,with no other apparent health problems,except for your contributing
product.
As an American citizen I have taken the liberty of assigning the law firm of Roer
and Lawyers of TampaFlorida who will be following the matter of this life and
death case very closely, as all this information is in regards to myself during my
degrees of dying. I will be following up with over 3,000 names of smokers that are
sick and dying as I am from your product.
Regards,
Serena JSohwab
