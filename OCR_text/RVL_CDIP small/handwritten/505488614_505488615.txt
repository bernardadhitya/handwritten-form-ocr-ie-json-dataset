Gentlemen:
Your suit with Mckenzie & Associates on behalf of Vincent Hanard
due to cigarette smoking is ludicrous, in so much as his family
said he did not know 'the dangers of smoking'. Has he been
going around with blinders on?
My husband died at the age of 6l with Emphasema and that was in
1964.He had been smoking 2 to 3 packs of Camels a day.When
he learned of the dangers associated with smoking in l963 and it
surely was well publicized he quit. If Mr. Hanard did not know
in the early 60's of this he must have been going around with
blinders on. No willpower.
Beer is harmful, liquour is harmful, too much fat is harmful,
then suffer the consequences.
out along with lawyer Melvin Belli who is a parasite living on the
saying he will win this time. I hope not for there will be thousands
who will be approached by xxxx "ambulance chasers" like Belli..
When my husband died I had 4 children, the youngest l3. I had
to take a second mortgage on my house, hospitalization insurance was
not a popular thing in i964 and the bills were heavy. However I
went to work though I was stricken with Multiple Sclerosis, and
we made out with the Lord's help.
You have a warning posted about smoking on each pack. Some folks
don't WANT to read.
I have friends who like to smoke (not me) and refuse to give it
up.They enjoy it, just like the guy who likes his cocktail, but
don't try to tell the public "he didn't know the dangers of smoking"
I don't agree with smoking. None of my children smoke. They saw
their father die of this but they learned of the dangers in l964
when he died and took a lesson from it.

I'm addicted to cookies. Should I sue Nabisco? I hope the Judge
can see Belli, Mckenzie & Associates, are the parasites who are
the ones who profit from these suits and they will bring thousands
8614
and "get rich quick".
I'm glad you did not settle with the Galbraith s of Stanton, CA.
Let Belli and his ilk sweat it out.
