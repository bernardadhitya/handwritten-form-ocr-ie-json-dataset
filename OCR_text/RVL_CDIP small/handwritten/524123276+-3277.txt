Dear David,
Mhank you for contactjng me with your concerns reyardiny
increasing taxes on smokcless tobacco. I appreciate hcaring from
you.
As you know, many of the health rcform packages now being debated
include an increasc in taxes on tobacco products as part. of the
revenue provision. While J have not made a final decision on the
proper method of funding the various reform proposals, I am
willing to consider an increasc in federal tobacco taxes in order
to fund a national hcalth care program.
A numbcr of heath carc advocates have madc powerful arguments
about thc cost to society of cigarette use, and have suggcsted
that a tax on tobacco is appropriate to help defray somc of that
cost.
My strong preference, howcver, is that we squeeze as much savings
out of the current health care system as we can. We currently
spend about $9oo billion every year on health care, much of it on
wastefu] and unnccessary administrative costs. Our first
priority shoud not bc to spend more,but to spend what. wc
already have more effectively.
Thank you again for contacting me.
P]ease fee] free to get in
touch with me jf you have any further concerns regarding this or
any other issue.
 Smokers Rights
Sincerely,
Nn
