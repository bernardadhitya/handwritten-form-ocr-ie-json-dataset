Dear Ms.Stroud
Thank you for contacting us. We appreciate your interest and would be happy to accommodate your
request.
Our Company policy states that we do not promote to anyone under the age of 21.Since your letter
did not state your age, we would ask that you call the toll-free number on your cigarette pack to
provide your date-of-birth. When we receive this information from you, we will be happy to send you a
Doral order form.
Again, thank you for taking the time to contact us. All of us at Reynolds send our best wishes
Sincerely,
wrel
