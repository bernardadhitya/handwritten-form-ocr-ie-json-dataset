1. A low sidestream cigarette could help the situation.but would not eliminate
the problem completely. Perhaps, the design and distribution of a "quiet"

2. Discuss at length and in detail the current Behavorial Sciences program in
Rerench.&rp
the Fundamental Seienee Divisiok'to determine if thrust can be directed
towards to understanding the underlying benefits and positive aspects of
smoking.
3. The Industry effort to do research on the passive smoking issue (Battelle
Project) should be speeded up as fast as possible. If the Industry effort
fails to move forward at a faster pace, then R&D should recommend an uni-
lateral approach to getting the data necessary to deal with the passive
smoking issue.

Work in this area has the greatest/chance of changing the current negative
opinion of the smoker and the Industry.
