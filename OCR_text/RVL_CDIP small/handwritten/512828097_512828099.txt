This disclosure represents a non-combustion cigarette
design which utilizes a cylindrical rod heat source; one pos-
sible source of heat in a cylindrical rod; and activation
methods for the total design. The cigarette design consists
of a cylindrical rod which represents an activatible heat
source.This rod is surrounded by tobacco which contains
nicotine and possibly additive flavorants. The tobacco and
heat rod are contained within a tube which may be paper plas-
tic or other suitable material. The mouth end is adapted with
a suitable mouthpiece to allow air flow through the rod but
prevent passage of loose tobacco particles.See illustra-
tions 1and2
A suitable heat source has been identified in the form of
super cooled sodium acetate tri-hydrate CHCOONa3H0.In
the present invention, the sodium acetate tri-hydrate was pre-
pared in accordance with information found in European Patent
Limited. In this form, Zanthan gum is utilized to hold the
CHgCOONa-3HO in a gel form in the super cooled state. The
CHcoONa3HO gel was placed in small cylindrical rods fabri-
cated from polypropylene.See illustration 3.
Upon introduction of a crystal of the CHCoONa3HO which
acts as a nucleating agent, the gel crystallizes giving up its
latent heat of crystallization to the surrounding tobacco sub-
strate. The heat of crystallization of CHcooNa3HO is in
the range of 50-55o c. The increased temperature of the
tobacco substrate allows increased amounts of nicotine and
other flavor volatiles to be transferred to the air stream
caused by puffing on the article.
