Months ago I sent you over 300 pack seals and ordered two
items irom your merchandise gift catalog. I received one of the
gifts but not the other which was a camera,I think)which you
said was out of stock. You enclosed a certificate good for 259 seals
which you said I could use.
But you did not enclose a catalog of avallable prizes so the
certificate was no good to me without something I could use it for.
I eventually talked to someone from your company on the
phonc. I was told that a new catalog of gifts would be sent to me.
Thcy alo caid that new catalogs were available at most outlets
that cod Dorasbut I couldn't find a store that had them. And I
1ceived nothng in the mall. Allyou ever mailed me since was
l sluff I could use to send in more pack seals for cartons of
cgarettes!
 hke Dorais but, franklyI can't tell much difference between
n ain reason Ibuy Dorals is to saye
e pack scals to send in for merchandise prizes. But you are
cortainly making it hard for rne to do this
If you dont_do_something.about this soon I'm going.to forget
