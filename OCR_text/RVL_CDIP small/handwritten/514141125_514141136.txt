RE:
RP Technology - SALEM Line Extension
This provides the Brand Group's recommendation regarding
application of the RP technology to sALeM.  In summary, the Brand
recommends two-SALEM-line-extensions incorporating the RP
technoligy-
pn an 85MM and 100MM FFLT Menthol.
Background
Project Rp was initiated in 1985 as a New Brands project which
combined R&D's technologies into a product offering smokers a
personal as well as a social acceptability benefit. The RP
technology combines a patented, magnesium hydroxide cigarette
puffed flued cured tobacco, 176 Turkish tobacco) to produce the
following benefits:
Less sidestream smoke
Low gas phase elementsin mainstream smoke
Low biological activity as-defined by the Ames test
Reduction in the amount of total smoke
(burns less tobacco and therefore less total smoke)
(See Exhibit A for respective benefits)
tdoac
Based upon the aforementioned benefits, potential advertising
claims include the following:
In August, 1988, VANTAGE will be introducing the Rp technology in
test market on 2 styles an 85MM and 100MM FFLT NM.The VANTAGE
RP (Project vrp) product is white-tipped, has a standard estron
filter and has 9mg of tar.VRp Development work was also
conducted on a FFLT Menthol 100mM style until 4th Quarter,1987.
To complete the reguired substantiation tests and introduce by
August, l988, a decision was made by Senior Management to limit
VRp's introduction to the two nonmenthol styles.
1) Reduced visible, lit-end smoke
2) Less total smoke
3) Reduced gas phase levels in mainstream and sidestream smoke
4) Reduced annoyance to others
5) Reduced biological activity (will not be leveraged in any
marketing elements for the RP proposition).
