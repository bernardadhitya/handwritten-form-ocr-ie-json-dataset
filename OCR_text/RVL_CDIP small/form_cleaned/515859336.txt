Sumary: Prof. Beidler is the world's leading authority on the biophysical
mechanisms of oral peroeption. With RJRr support he has been studying the
binding of nicotine to salivary proteins, the role of tissue retention in after-
taste, the stimulation of different salivary glands with natural and pharma-
cological stimuli and the permeability of epithelia to nicotine as a function
Of pH.
In the present research, Prof. Beidler will determine the effect of
levulinic and other acids on the permeability of sensory epithelia from the
mouth and nose to nicotine.
He will determine if such effects can be explained
in terms of the change in pH which each acid produces in the fluid overlying
the reoeptors of the olfactory, trigeminal or qustatory receptors.
This
research will provide important
information for the modification of the
sensory properties of nicotine and sensory smoke by the addition of acids to
cigarettes
