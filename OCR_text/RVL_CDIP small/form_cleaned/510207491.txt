PROPOSAL
This proposal is to simplify the flue-cured reconstituted flavors by removal of those
related toRJRT's Flavor/Ingredient Protocol. These components.are 2-acetyifuran, furfural,
furfuryl alcohol, crotoni8~acid, isophorone, and 3,5-dimethylpyridine. The attached list
indicates the brands with these flavor components. Panel test results on NOw 85,NOw 100,and
without questionable components. These flavor components were originally included in formulas
based on reconstitution of tobacco flavors.
OBJECTIVES:
The objective is to remove items that are of questionable status.
These changes will save about $8s0o in raw material costs.
