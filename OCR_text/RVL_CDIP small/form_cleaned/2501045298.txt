Re:
IARC ETS STUDY
Attached is a barely legible copy of a page from the Directory of Smoking
and Health Research reporting on an IARC ETS epidemiological study.Also
attached is a copy of the original report retyped.
I thought you would be interested in this information pursuant to the
discussions in New York regarding IARC activity in the ETS area.
Regards.
