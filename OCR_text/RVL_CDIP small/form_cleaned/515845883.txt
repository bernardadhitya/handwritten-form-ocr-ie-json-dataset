Approval Requested
This is to request approval for the introduction of Camel Filters into the Curitiba Test Market
on April 5,1982. With the introduction of Camel Filters,the brand group wants to test
exploiting a market opportunity that has recently been identified. Specifically the brand group.
proposes to test Camel Filters as an alternative to Hollywood, taking advantage of Hollywood's
product life maturity. Moreover, Camel Filters has a unique opportunity to establish itself as
a male cigarette without the usually negative perceptions of too strong and too downscale.
Currently there is no cigarette in the market with such a unique positioning..
it can sustain this share level, the brand will be rolled-out nationally on October 25,1982
