2.OTHER AREAS:Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers - including those sensitive to tobacco smoke
frequently must use while traveling, and where they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g.,restrooms,
telephones, eating areas, baggage claim, news stands and other stores, ticket counters, etc.)? If yes, explain why these areas are
important to travelers, and what smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted.PRINT
