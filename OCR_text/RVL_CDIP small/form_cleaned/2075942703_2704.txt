Abstract: Three isomers of l-menthol, which occur to varying degrees in natural mint oils, used as flavorants in
the tobacco industry, possess widely differing flavors and trigeminal perceptions. Earlier work at Philip
Recently, d-ncomenthol, d-isomenthol and d-menthol have become commercially available, but in less than
the commercially unavailable d-neoisomenthol is also described.The purification method involves the
"duplication" strategy of covalently appending two (or more) menthol subunits to a symmetrical achiral
backbone, and then recrystallizing the resulting products.The terephthalates and especially the 2,6-

naphthalenedicarboxylates, prepared by sodium hydride catalyzed transesterification of the methyl esters
in boiling xylene, were all found to crystallize readily, and effected efficient purification of each menthol
Isomer from both enantiomeric and diastereomeric impurities. The purified menthol isomer content of the
