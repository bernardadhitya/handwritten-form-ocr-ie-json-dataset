Re.lnvoice Project P3216.your fax of20July 1995
Dear Mr.Jakins:
We agree to your proposal to deduct  1,400.00 from your invoicc # 115812 of 14 June
1995, due to inadequate slide quality in 40% of the larynx slides.Since we cannot use
these slides for evaluation purposes, we wou!d like to point out that the actual damage
incurred is many times higher than your discount.
If there is to be possible future collaboration we will have to find ways to ensure reliable
quality.
Sincerely yours,
Dr.Wolf Reininghau
