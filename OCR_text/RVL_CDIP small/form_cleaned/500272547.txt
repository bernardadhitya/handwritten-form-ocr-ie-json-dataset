The influence of nicotine on sodium anc potessium permeability of Cenervated frog
sartorius and rat extensor digitorum longus musclcs will be examined using intrecellular
microelectroccs and radioactive tracer tcchniques. The denervated muscle develops
extrajunctional receptors with cxpanced chemosensitivity which provces a nearly ideal
preparetion for.investigatins the cffects of nicotine on the permeability of the end
platc. Sy rcasuring muscle cell action potcntials and resting potentials in intect end
Cenervated muscles fron the seme enimal in conjunction with recioactive potassium end
sodium fluxes,it will be possible to cbtain a cuantitative mathematical correletion
bctween thcsc varieblcs cnd e Cirect meens of Cistinguishing between the effects cf
nicotnc on end plate versus mcmbrane concuction. The date obteinec frem this propcsed
stucy should epply to other chcmosensitive sites in the centrel nervous system end
peripherel nervous system affcctcc by nicotine end in adcition shec sone light on the
mechenisn of transmission blockace procuced by nicotine.
