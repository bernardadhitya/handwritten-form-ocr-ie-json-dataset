The objcctive of the proposed rcscarch is to ceicrmine, by using nicotine in
studics on the electrical and mcchanical characteristics of isolated mammalian heart
muscle, mechanisms responsble for changes in contractility and, in particular, the
mechansms responsble for thc cecreased contracility that occurs during heart failure
Preparations of cat papillary muscle and dog atrial trabeculae will be obtained from
normal hcar.s and from hcarts in failure induced by chronic pulmonary ariery con-
striction. Portions ofnormal and cseased human rnyocardium will be obtained from
humans uncergoing open hcar surgery. Scveral concentrations of nicotine will be
added to the perfusate for both normal and faied animal and human myocardial
will be obaincd to cc.crmine if nicotine differentially affects force development by
norma ard failcd mvocardum. The lengh-tension relation and ciastolic compliance
will be examined in similarly perused preparations during controled sequential
changes in length; these length changes will incluce excessive amounts o strech so
that cptimal length can be deicrmined. These cata will permit a comparison of the
effecs of ncotine on diastolic compliance and optimal length for normal and failed
muscles and may incicate if nicotine influences carciac output by altering the pressure
volumc rclationship for the intact hcart by actons acditional or scparate from its
positive inotropic action.'The actions of nicotine wll be determined on aftercontractions
induced by cardiac glycosides, calcium, low temperature and catecholamines in
normal and failed muscles. Simultancous monitoring of electrical and mechanical
activity will allow an analysis of whether nicotine acts on transmembrane potentials
or mechanical "threshold potentials. These daa may indicate if cardiac after-
contractions can be affccted by direct mobilization of intracellular calcium and if
aftercontractions may arise from different mechansms,
