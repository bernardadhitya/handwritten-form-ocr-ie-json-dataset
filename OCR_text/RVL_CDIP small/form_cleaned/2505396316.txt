Henry Moncure, Ed Carmines and I mot today and discussed status and next steps
for the smoking machlnes. We are thinking that a trip of INBlFO folks to check out at
least three machines and train TRI and KC personnel might best be scheduled for
9/7-9/12,based on schedules trom Henry. In order to do this effectively, the items
on the attached list should be considered. In particular, number 4 seem essential for
training purposes, and would be more effective if lt could be made available to
participants prior to the training session. Does thls seem like a reasonable plan? 1
plan to call on Wednesday,8/25,to discuss details,but wanted you to have time to
think about it before then.Thank youl
