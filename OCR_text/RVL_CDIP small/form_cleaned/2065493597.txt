Comments:
David, we were successful in getting the 4 major business organizations in Florida to jointly
sign a letter to the legislature calling for the repeal of SB 2110. The letters were hand
delivered to each of the legislative offices this morning.Sen.Charles Williams will have a
press conference this morning announcing his sponsorship of the repeal bill. Thanks.
