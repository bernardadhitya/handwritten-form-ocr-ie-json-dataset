tinuing thru on or about April 91998 excepting approximately 36 days in November/December
of 1997 while housed in SHU) at F.C.I.Big Spring,Texas where I was assigned during this
time period, I was exposed daily to "secondhand smokein the housing unit I lived in which
was Sunrise Unit. Although the hcusing units were off limits to smoking, many inmates would
violate this rule daily. Those inmates who did go outside, congregated at the exit/entrance
doors further exposing me to "secondhand smoke" almost every time I walked in or out of the
unit. This problem was remedied by the Warden in SHu by not allowing cigarettes sold to in-
mates while housed there, yet inmates in the general population could easily buy cigarettes
inmates like myself in our living quarters which was only due to negligence by BOP staff
