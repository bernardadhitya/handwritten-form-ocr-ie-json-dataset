ROPOSAL:
Measurement of the human smoking characteristics of male smokers,21-34 years of age
will be made. Twenty each of regular WInstoN and regular Marlboro smokers will be used for
each test. Cigarettes will be obtained from samples used in NFo tests. A baseline testin
which cigarettes from the most recent NFo test practical will be used, is to be conducted as
soon as possible. Further tests will be made on cigarettes from subsequent mailouts only if
the NFo test result warrants. Samples will be retained from each mailout, pending their need
in a smoking test. Results from NFo and smoking characteristic measurements will be compared
to identify links which could lead to improvement of winsroN versus Marlboro. See attachment
for background information).
