COMMENTS/MESSAGE
Here are copies of the media plan and minute-by-minute. Press release and other
materials are being drafted.
We feel it will cut down on a lot of logistical nightmares to run this whole
operation through Sawyer Miller (i.e., management and implementation).
We at PM will plan to make our communications teams and consultants available
to execute portions of the plan as deemed necessary by Sawyer Miller
