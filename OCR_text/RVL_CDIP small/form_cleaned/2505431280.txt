European Contract Research Laboratories
Dear Gerry:
Hans-Jurgen asked me to provide him with a list of the 5 topcontract labs in Europe for Ed
Carmines.I think the following institutions fall into that category.
Please note that Huntingdon at the moment has some problems with GLP and animal
protection.
Kind regards,
