Scheduling of inhalation studios
Dear Gerry:
Piter Terpstra has plotted the optimal schedule for performing up to 4 standard 90 d
inhalation assays over 1 year.The meaning of the different blocks on each of the time
lines is:28 d cigarette conditioning + analytical smoking + machine preparation,90 d
2 and 3.The duration of the following evaluation process depends on the overall load on
the labs involved and the extent of endpoints investigated.
Please note that we prefer no overlap of the exposures in 2nd to 3rd and in the 4th
quarter, because of holidays.
Kind regards,
Wolf Reininghau
