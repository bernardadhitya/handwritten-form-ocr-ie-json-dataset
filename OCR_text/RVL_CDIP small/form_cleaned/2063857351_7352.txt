COMMENTS CONCERNING SMOKING IN AIRPORTS
1. PATH ONLY: DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke "a path of access from the terminal
entrance to the aircraft free from exposure to tobacco smoke," perhaps by using "an enclosed cart that took the passenger through
the airport without exposure to smoke," would provide sufficient protection. Do you agree or disagree?Why? PRINT
