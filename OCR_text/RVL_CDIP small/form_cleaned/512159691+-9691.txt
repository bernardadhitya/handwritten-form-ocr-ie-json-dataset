SUBJECT:TOW CHANGE FOR CAMEL WIDES LIGHTS (to 2.0/35000
BACKGROUND:The current tow item for CAMEL WIDES Lights is 2.1/48000).It is a
small quantity tow item for RJR and the last shipment received was of extremely low
yield which would result in low cigarette drafts/high tars.Since replacement 2.1/48000
will not be available in time, and since 2.0/35000 offers a satisfactory solution, it is
recommended to switch to 2.0/35000.Testing has been done with 2.0/35000 in
conjunction with by-product utilization for future implementation.
RISK ASSEssMENT: Extremely low risk since 2.0/35000 has been tested at a tip draft
matching the current
RECOMMENDATION: Switch to 2.0/35000 at a tip draft matching the current target.
