Text of Abstract (please type)
It is generally assumed that nicotine can be absorbed
into the systemic circulation by non-inhaling cigar
smokers but not by non-inhaling cigarette smokcrs. The
experiments to be described show that plasma nicotine
levels increase by only very small amounts (of the
order of 1-2 ng/ml) from either form of smoking, rhen
absorption is only possible from the buccal cavity and
nasopharynx. The reason for this is believed to be the
short contact time that normal smoking allous for the
smoke to be in contact with target organs. lhen
compared with the lungs, this route bffers a relatively
inefficient pathway to the systemic circulation.
