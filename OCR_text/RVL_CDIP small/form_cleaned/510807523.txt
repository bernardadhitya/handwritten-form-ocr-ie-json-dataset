Test Objective:
To determine the effect of vent hole location on the perceptual characteristics
of Now 85 prototypes made with sTr filters.
Previous testing SED #1235] of N0w 85 protototypes which employed sTT filters
did not indicate a perceptual effect of the sTr filter.  It was hypothesized
that the vent hole placement used on the prototypes precluded any effect of the
STT filter.
The results of this study will be used by the xB product development team in
the development of XB prototypes, and by Brands R&D in the development of NOw
prototypes.
Product Descriptions:
ANl0838AA:Now 85 prototype which employes a sTr filter (flavored with tobacco
extract). The prototype is ventilated at 13mm from the mouth end.
ANl0838AB:Now 85 prototype which employes a STT filter (flavored with tobacco
extract). The prototype is ventilated at 17mm from the mouth end.
AN10838Ac:NOw 85 prototype which employes a STT filter (flavored with tobacco
extract). The prototype is ventilated at 23mm from the mouth end.
