See attached.
Item #9: No additional canment is necessary in the text regarding levels
of GGrp since a valid assay may reflect levels of 3-4 lu/l or
lower. However, Tables Ccin6 and Cch43 have been revised to
indicate low levels of activity were detected rather than lack
of sufficient data. Therefore the footnote has been changed
to read #extremely low levels of activity,including no reactivity."
