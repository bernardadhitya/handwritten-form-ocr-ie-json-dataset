ABSTRACT
A previously unreported compound,2,3-dimethyl-6-(4,8,12-
trimethyltridecyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (solanoquinone) was
isolated from tobacco and smoke by a combination of liquid-liquid
partitioning, column chromatography, preparative tlc, and gas
chromatography.Solanoquinone was first isolated from a low alka-
loid bright lamina and was identified by use of ir, uv,NR,and
ms..The compound was synthesized by a Diels-Alder reaction of
neophytadiene with .2,3-dimethylbenzoquinone, resulting in'a product
which was identical to the isolated solanoquinone.
Quantitation of solanoquinone in tobacco and smoke was
accomplished with a rapid procedure using preparative tlc
followed by gc.The amount of solanoquinone in a sample of
flue-cured lamina was found to be 2ooo times higher than the
amount in an uncured sample from the same crop which was
freeze-dried after harvest.
