Triumph Disaster Check Study..5546/1979
Research Design (N CellsElegibilityDesignKey Banner FreaksMethodolyCities)
Contact respondents from Buffalo and Kansas City who had previously participated
in a steak knife offer. This will consist of one cell of approximately 175 respondents
who are Triumph most often smokers/triers. This study isintended to provide us with
any negatives associated with Triumph. Banner points will include Triumph most often
smokers (we anticipate approximately 25 most often people), switchers away from Triumph
N approximately 45). It should be noted that an action standard of at least 50% be
research limitations below for additional action standard.
See attached memo
Key Criteria For Analysis
-Triumph switchers asked why no longer smoking Triumph
-Present smokers of Triumph asked reasons for switching to Triumph
Mentions. of "harshness
Research Limitations
Due to sample size and experience we feel 25 respondents will presently be Triumph
smokers. An action standard of 75% should be utilized for judgments on product negatives
only among this group.
If 75% of Triumph smokers mention "harshness"we could consider it a problem. If
50-75% of Triumph smokers mention "harshnesswe could consider it a possible problem
look at other areas).
