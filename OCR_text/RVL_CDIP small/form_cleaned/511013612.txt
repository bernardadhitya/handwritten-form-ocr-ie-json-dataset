cCo1um
TYPE OF CHANGE:
Removal of Transport Jet
PURPOsE OF CHANGE:Decrease filter efficiency to raise tar
DATE OF PHASE III STARTUP WITH CHANGE:10/20/83
DURATION OF CHANGE:
Permanent
ESTIMATED VOLUME FOR CHANGE:
Norma1
BASIS FOR RECOMMENDATION:
The transport jet was implemented in Ph. III on 10/12/83. At that point,
tar was too high. This change was made to increase filter efficiency,
therefore reducing tar. After monitoring several shifts of Ph. III
datatar is lower than anticipated. We recommend that transport jet be
removed to raise the tar level back to 17.1 mg. A11 areas concerned should
use specification sub-brand number 1005 AI.
