A.
Initiator of Test:Denise Donaher
Date Submitted:March 28,1994
B.
Purpose of Test:
Previous tests have shown that there are subjective differences between RLB made with
Wiegand liquor vs. the wiped film liquor. Further testing is needed to evaluate other
running conditions of the Wiegand systems to determine if these subjective differences
are lessened. Therefore the purpose of this test is to evaluate alternate operating
conditions for the further testing with RLB liquor which is planned for the week of April
18th.
C.
Test Procedure:
This pre-testing will be conducted while the Wiegand in on water wash. Therefore,
ensure that DNCEL levels are sufficient to allow the Wiegand system to be on water for
approximately 3 hours for the testing. The following operating variables will be evaluated
to determine how much they can be lowered and still maintain stable operation:
(1)
The preheat temperature will be lowered to 130 F and allowed to stabilize.
Operation of the system will be monitored by Doug Chapman and Denise
Donaher and the decision may be made to try other conditions.
(2)
The vapor temperature set point will be lowered to 120 F.The vacuum
system will be monitored to determine if there is sufficient vacuum
capacity to maintain these conditions. Other vapor temperature setpoints
will be tested if necessary as determined by Doug Chapman and Denise
Donaher.
D.
Test samples and Lab analysis required:
none
