Nicotine concentrations were determined in passenger cabins of
B727 and B737 aircraft during domestic flights in order to assess
the effectiveness of smoker segregation as a means of minimizing
exposure of non-smokers to ETs. Sampling systems including
constant flow pumps and sorbent tubes containing XAD-4 resin were
used to collect integrated samples of nicotine. Sampling systems
were concealed in briefcases to ensure that sampling operations
were unobtrusive. Analysis involved desorption of nicotine into
ethyl acetate and quantification with gas chromatography and
nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Twenty-three samples were acquired
in smoking sections and thirty-nine samples in no-smoking sections
at the boundaries with smoking sections. In no-smoking,bgundary
sections, nicotine concentrations ranged from 0 to 40 g/m3 with
an arithmetic mean of 1l g/m3. In smoking sections, nicotine
concentratjons ranged from 0 to 112 g/m3 with an arithmetic mean
of 23 g/m3. Sampiing times ranged from 13 to 179 minutes with an
arithmetic mean of 57 minutes. Results indicate that no-smoking
sections are essentially ETS-free for aircraft such as B727's and
B737's,which have "once.through" ventilation systems.
