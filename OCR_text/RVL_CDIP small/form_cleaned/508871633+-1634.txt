Eight unopened and one opened pack manufactured during shift
8in February 1988 at #12 coded 1 2 0) were returned along with
two butts which were deeply stained blue/black. The complaint
was that, while the smoker was preoccupied with Tv, one of those
cigarettes was smoked which stained the smoker's mouth and
fingers. Examination of the butts leads to the conclusions that
the source of the blue color was neither from within the filter
plug nor from the tobacco rod but was the result of an external
application to the tipping and/or cigarette paper.
The dye was extracted along with normal tobacco components
and subjected to infrared analysis. The spectra suggested a
sodium azo-sulfonate dye. An example of such a compound would be
methyl blue, which is used medicinally as an antiseptic. We
cannot speculate on the origin of such a substance on the
cigarettes in question.
