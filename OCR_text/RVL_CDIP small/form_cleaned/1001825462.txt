Evidence is presented that in the copyrolysis of
carbohydrates and inorganic sulfur compounds, carbonyl
sulfide is formed from the decomposition of thioacetic
acid. This acid.is proposed as an intermediate from the
reaction of ketene and hydrogen sulfide.
Ketene isa
decomposition product of carbohydrates. Hydrogen
sulfide is derived from the reaction of sulfur and alkanes
The latter compounds result
from thedegradation of the
carbohydrates
