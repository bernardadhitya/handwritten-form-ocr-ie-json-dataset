1. DESCRIPTION OFTHE INVENTION (in sufficient detail for the invention to be understood;
please identify or attach copies of any reportsnotebook pages or other documents con-
taining particular examples or other pertinent data):
Ihis invention employs the use of B-diketones to form dihydropyridines and
pyridines.
Reaction of acetylacetone with ethyl
B-amino crotonate for
example would generate 2,4,6-triethyl nicotinic
acid and 2,4,6-trimethy1-
nicotinates.These would be important for formation
of2,46-trimethylni-
cotines.
Other -diketones and substituted
-amino crotonates would
yield 2,4,6-trialkylnicotinic acids and their esters
for formations
of 2,4,6-trialky1 nicotines
7101-7.5
which could be converted to 2,4-6-trialkylnicotines by known paths.
3. STATE OF THE ART (list any known patents or publications that seem pertinent:
24,6-trialkyl nicotinates2,4-6-trialkyl nicotinic acidsand 2,4,6-
trialkylnicotines are unknown. All should have important biological
activity.
