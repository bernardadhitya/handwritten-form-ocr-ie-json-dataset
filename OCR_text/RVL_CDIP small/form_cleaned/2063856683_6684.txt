COMMENTS CONCERNING SMOKING IN AIRPORTS
1.PATH ONLY:DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke "a path of access from the terminal
entrance to the aircraft free from exposure to tobacco smoke," perhaps by using "an enclosed cart that took the passenger through
the airport without exposure to smoke,would provide sufficient protection.Do you agree or disagres?WhyPRINT

2.QTHER AREAS:Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers -including those sensitive to tobacco smoke
-frequently must use while traveling, and where they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (c.g., restrooms,
telephones, eating areas, baggage claim, news stands and other stores, ticket counters, etc.)? If yes, explain why these areas are
important to travelers, and what smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted. PRINT
