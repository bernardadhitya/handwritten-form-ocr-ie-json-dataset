Assumptions Used in Arriving at Fiscal Estimate
This bill regulates smoking in university buildings which house educational
programs and in inpatient health care facilities. Smoking within these
buildings would be allowed only in specified facilities or rooms, provided.
It is estinated that, on the average, university buildings would each
estimated at $4.50 in 1982-83 dollars. This estinate is based on the
1981 per sign costand increased to reflect inflation from 198l to 1983.
Thus, the expected one-time cost for the University System to implement
the provisions of the bill would be about $8,000. There are no significant
continuing annual costs associated with the bill's provisions.
