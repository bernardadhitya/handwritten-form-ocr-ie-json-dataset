RE:
CIGAREETE QUESTIONNAIRE
Here is yet another version of the questionnalre. Please note that the last 2 pages are
the alternate versions that we discussed. Take a look at the alternate Q9 to try to get at
the intensity issue, and maybe we can improve on it from here.
By the way, we recelved 13 more signature cards today and sent the cigarettes out. We
are now up to74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopefully we will get a lot
of callbacks this weekend.
Talk to you Monday.Thanks
