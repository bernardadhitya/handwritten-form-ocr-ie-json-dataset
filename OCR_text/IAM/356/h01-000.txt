Questions about marriage and children were again included, as they had been at the
1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked for marriage details for all married

questions related to all women who were or had been married, and so repeated the
enquiry made fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family Census conducted on behalf of
the Royal Commission on Population.
