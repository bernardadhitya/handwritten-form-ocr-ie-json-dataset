We gathered together a splendid Sunday afternoon service at the church, each child
being given a number which, as they came into church, they could just whisper to the
superintendent who filled in the register at her own home. Each child had a picture
given them and the lesson was largely based on this. It was on a stamp which could
be stuck in their book, and there was quite a clamour for back stamps if a child had
to miss the Sunday Church from any cause which the Vicar considered justifiable!
