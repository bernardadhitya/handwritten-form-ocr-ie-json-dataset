It was quite amusing to see how much the children enjoyed the service, and I heard
of parents or faithful nurses threaten any naughty child with the penalty of not being
allowed to come to the Children's Church on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat

great joy to meet them now fifty years afterwards when so many are parents or even
grandparents, and one of the present churchwardens and several officials of the church
still remember those days.
