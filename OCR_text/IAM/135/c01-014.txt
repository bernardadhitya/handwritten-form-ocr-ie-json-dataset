The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is largely a satire on the petty
court surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply egocentric character leads him to
sacrifice everything to his need of inspiration. Henze obtains his musical characteri-
sation by means of individual instrumental timbres andpersonal" intervals, and the
result is often less delineation of character than caricature. This is also the chief, or
at least the most successfully executed trait of the libretto, which contains an odd
blend of highly poetic phraseology and schoolboy humour.
