A sum of 160,000 was demanded- a staggering figure to mediaeval eyes. It was deter-
mined that 100,o00 was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find two-thirds
of this sum providing the clergy supplied the remainder. The method of assessment
to which the Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest injustice of
this method had been to a certain degree corrected by the sliding scale of the second
poll-tax, but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in weight by a flat-rate
tax at treble the rate - every adult had to pay three groats, but this time an adult
was re-defined as anyone over fifteen.
