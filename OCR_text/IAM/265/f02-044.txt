In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M.Banks,Assistant Director of Education for
Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready to let older employees attend day-
release courses on preparation for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus
spent. An approach was made to about twenty large firms and in October, 1959, the
first experimental day-release course for men was organised. Eleven students from
seven firms attended a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both to the men
and their employers that the venture was an experiment from which the organisers
hoped to learn as much as the participants.
