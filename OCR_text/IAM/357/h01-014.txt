Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions about housing and house
holds. In 1961 the scope of the question was wider than before, because of the great
use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local Governr
ent and to local authori-
ties. As before, the record made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residential
premises and temporary places of abode, and all households occupying them, as the
basis of the enumeration is the household schedule.
