it is a good idea to condition a child to some extent against it. To keep a child of
twelve or thirteen under the impression that nothing nasty ever happens is not merely
dishonest, it is unwise. As I shall suggest in a later chapter there are some situations
which occur less frequently than they did once, or at least do not now arise until a
later period of life, but this is no reason for leaving a child in complete ignorance to
the extent of even lying to it when it asks questions.
