It is believed that about 60 per cent of the employees of London firms transferring
their business to the new towns moved with them and were thus eligible to rent a
corporation house. Additional workers are recruited through the industrial selection
scheme by arrangement with the Ministry of Labour. This scheme is designed to
ensure that vacancies in the London new towns which cannot be filled locally are filled
as far as possible from people on London housing lists, who thus become entitled to
rent a house in the new town..
