The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by experiment for each batch
of resin using radioactive tracer (lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is
shown in Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight of resin
used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates that the fractions containing lead
and bismuth are free of cross contamination apart from the natural ingrowth of the
daughters arising from the decay of lead.
