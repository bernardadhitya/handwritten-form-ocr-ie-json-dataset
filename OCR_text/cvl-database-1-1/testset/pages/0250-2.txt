And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,

Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And Porkure on his damned quauel smiling.
Show'd eike arebel's whore: Bwt all's tottl.
