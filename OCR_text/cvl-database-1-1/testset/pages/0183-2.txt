And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.

too ceau: Tor hrave Nomacs-cuey he
cith his brandish'd steei,.
Which smoue with hlood execuhon,
Til he Paced the slave
