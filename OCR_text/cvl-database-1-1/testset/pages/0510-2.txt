And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;
Shou'd lihe a vebel's uhove : but all's foo ueat:
Fo bvave Nomaes ~ well he deserves fhat name .
