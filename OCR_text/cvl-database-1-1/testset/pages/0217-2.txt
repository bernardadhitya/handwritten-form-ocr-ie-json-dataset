And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
And fertune, on his damned querrel smiling
Show'd lke a rebels whore:but ql's to weqk

Disdaining fortune, with hus brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody exewhon,
Like valour's minion casved wt his p4ssey
Tll he Rced the s|9ve;
