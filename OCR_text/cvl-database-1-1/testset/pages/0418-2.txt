And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.

Like valour's minion carved out his passage

Ano forture, onhis domes guanel smling
Show'l like arebel's whore: bat all' too weak.
For brave Nonoes- nel( ke seeres Chot nome
Didoining fortune, wilh hs brondsh's! stoel.
