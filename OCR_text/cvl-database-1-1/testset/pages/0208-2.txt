And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,

Like valour's minion carved out his passage.

For  brve WVomcs-ceell he desene Hct uone
Whicl smolec! cith blocdy erecuten,
