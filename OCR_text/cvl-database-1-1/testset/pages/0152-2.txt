And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
en hs canne0 Juanel oncikir
Gke a rebel! whore: buf alls fc reak.
FOr
well he cle/erves tha.
