And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,.
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;.
sno( fo lin on hic damred quarel omiliy
Show'd lik e rebel'!rohoe: bul oll' leo weak:.

Mhic omoked wilh bloody eeeclion,
Gihe oolour'd mirion cirved Eul hirpanayl.
Till he fceo lhe nlaoej.
