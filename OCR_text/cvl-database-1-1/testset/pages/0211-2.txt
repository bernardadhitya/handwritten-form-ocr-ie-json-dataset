And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;
And forkune1 on Ris oLomned quorrel zmiling.
Shw'd like a rebeI' whore : bur oll' soo weak:
For Braoe Jmoc7-well Qe derewesho1 nome
Dirdaining fortune, wu th Ri, brondish'd steee,.

Like vIrr' miion coroed ouf his yorrog.
