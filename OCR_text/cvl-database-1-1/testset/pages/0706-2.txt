And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel.
Which smoked with bloody execution,.
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
Anf fortun, n hin druned qmarl nmiliny
Shou'd hke a rebI's nhoe: bul al's 1oo wenk.
Far brawe Nmnrs- neU he dereve thol nune.
Disdoining fovhune, nilh hir hrondirh'd vkeel.
