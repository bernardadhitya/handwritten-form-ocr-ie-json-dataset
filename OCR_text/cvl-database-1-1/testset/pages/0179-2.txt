And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
And frtune on his damned quarrel Smilinq.

For qrave Nomacs -wsell he deserves tuat name -
Lke valour'S minion crved owt ws passaqe.
