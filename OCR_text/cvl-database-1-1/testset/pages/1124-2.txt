And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And forfyne, ouhis. ohmned! gnarel smiling
Showdl like arebels whore: Sut ads too weak
FoF brave Nouacs - well he desoves Hhaf name
Discaininy fortune, with his bmrdshd steel
Which smoked w:th b1xdly
executiou
Like va1ours miniou carvedl ouf his Passage
Till he saced Ahe slave.
