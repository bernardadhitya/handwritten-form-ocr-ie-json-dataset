And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Ael faune, en his damned quavr' smling
Shaw'd iikr e rebel's whou : tul all's leo wrak
Fa eae Nomecs -wrll Re clesewes thal name -
Dsclaininq feuun?,wuh his bandsh'd suel,
Which smked wilh oledy exeaulien,
