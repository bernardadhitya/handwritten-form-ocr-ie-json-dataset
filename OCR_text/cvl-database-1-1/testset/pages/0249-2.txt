And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
And fortune, on his d0mwred quarel@ smiling
Show'd lihe arehel's whore: bwt all'stoo weak.
tor brave Nomocs~well he dQserves thot nQme-
Disdaininq fortwre,with his brandi3h'd skel
Which 3noked wit blody executionj
Like voIas's runion carved owt his pass0qe
Tiu he facec te slawe;
