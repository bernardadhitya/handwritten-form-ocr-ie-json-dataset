And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Auo formue, ou lis damreci guarrel omifbiy
Sheu'cl liee a reer's whor: lof al1's towal
Fer bare Nbuaes -well he deserredfaf none-
Widh fpmIee1 ith 6kc1g execut,ouj
Lihe ialor's mminiou 0arvid cut los Jessage
Till he fecce! the stawo.
