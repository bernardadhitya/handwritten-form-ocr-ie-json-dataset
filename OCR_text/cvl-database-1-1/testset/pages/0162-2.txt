And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
And Iortune, on his clamned qwurel smiling,

Disdaininy Rortune wifh his brandish'd steel,
Whih smoked with bWodly execution
Like vawour's minion CQvel ouf his pasape
Till We Raced Hhe slave,
