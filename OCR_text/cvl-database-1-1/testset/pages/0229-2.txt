And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:.
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Ard mea fortune,on nis damned quarre1 smilinq;.
Shaw'd liue J rebei's whore: bul all's loo weah:
For brsve Nomcs - well hI deserves lhal name -
Which smOhed with bloody execuiiOn,.
Tll he faceo the slave;
