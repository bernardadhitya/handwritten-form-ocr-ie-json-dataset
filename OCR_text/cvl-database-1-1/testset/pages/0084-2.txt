And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name -.
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
Aud fortuue 1on lu, dQuweo! quorel ouuliug
Suaw'd lke a rebl's whore! but aQ's to weok:
For bmve Nouacs - wel be dlseves that nawe
Didoiuiwg fortuue, wilh li braudih'd sleel
Wluh Juwked wnh blocdy executiou1
Like volour's wiuiou corved ouf lus panage
Til he faed the slove;
