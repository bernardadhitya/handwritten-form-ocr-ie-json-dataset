And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,.
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And fortune  on ho domned quarrd shiliny
Show'd like a rebel's whorc but dll's too weaf:
For braVe Nomacs-we1l he deservy tHof name
Dis,duininy fortuane, w:th hs braudish't steel.
Whith smoKed w:h boody execat1on!
Like vdlour's minin carved oat his penege
Till he fued thi slave;.
