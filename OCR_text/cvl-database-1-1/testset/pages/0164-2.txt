And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
And forhne, on Ris dsmned quarel smiling
Sows'd lke a rebl's whore : bul oll's hoorweak:
Fo7 brae Vomscs-well he dasewes bsT nsme -
Disdoinirg Joulune, silh bloody ecuion,.
Kike valour's minion cowet ou his passage.
Till he fhiks foces be slovej.
