And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;.
And jornne,on his damned quarrel smiCng,

For brave Nomocs -well he deerrethgt name-
Disdaining hortne, with his Srandish'd skel,
Which smohed with bloody execuhon,
Lihe valor's mi^ion carred out hispassage
Tiee he fQced the jlavei.
