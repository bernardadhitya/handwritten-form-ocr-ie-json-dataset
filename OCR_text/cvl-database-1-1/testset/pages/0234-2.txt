And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,

Disdkining krhure, woih his brandish'd skel,.
Whish smched uoith blody lxeculion,
like nolowr's mimion creol out his possage.
