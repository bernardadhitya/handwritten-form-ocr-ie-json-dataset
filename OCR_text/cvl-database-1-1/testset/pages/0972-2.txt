And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;.
Aul fortoue, ou his dcuued qoavvel suiliug
Show'd like a vebel's whove: but all's too weck:
Fov bvave Nowacs-well he desewes thut uaue-
DisIaiuiug fovtune, wih his SvcnIsh'd stcel,.
Which swoled with bloodp executieu,
Like valouvs miuiou carvel ouf his passage
Till he faced the slave;.
