And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,.
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;.

For brave Nouacs- will le deseves fqt idwue-
