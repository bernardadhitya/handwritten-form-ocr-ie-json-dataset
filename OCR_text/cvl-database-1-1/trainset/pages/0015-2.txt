And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,.
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Nomacs - well he deserves that name-
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage.
Till he faced the slave;
Fer brave Nemacs- wel he desrges thef mame-.
bisdaiming fottune, with hin brandish'd steel,
Till he faud thu lave;
