While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened - there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind -
the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight - my brain reeled as I saw the.

of a thousand waters - and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently.
over the fragments of the "House of Usher."
