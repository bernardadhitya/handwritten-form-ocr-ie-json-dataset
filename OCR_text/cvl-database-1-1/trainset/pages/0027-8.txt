the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight - my brain reeled as I saw the
mighty walls rushing asunder - there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice
of a thousand waters - and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently
over the fragments of the "House of Usher.'
