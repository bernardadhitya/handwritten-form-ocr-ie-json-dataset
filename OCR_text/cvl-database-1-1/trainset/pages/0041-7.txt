You have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my
curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because you were marvellous, because.
you had genius and intellect, because you realised the dreams of great poets and gave.
shape and substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow.
and stupid.
