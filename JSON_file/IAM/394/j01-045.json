    "text": "Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated with niobium separated from the coolant by a solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from the reference electrode would mean oxidizing conditions for niobium and positive voltage, non-oxidizing conditions. The practical application of the above idea will involve considerable experimentation before it can be realised.",
