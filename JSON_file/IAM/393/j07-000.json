    "text": "This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's, the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction became established for aero-engine radiators using dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages were separated by flat plates.",
