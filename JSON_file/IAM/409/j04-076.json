    "text": "At the end of five days, bismuth-210 will have reached one-half of its equilibrium value and can be counted through an aluminium absorber sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles from lead-210 and the alpha particles from polonium-210. Earlier beta counting is permissible but the sensitivity of the method is reduced (See Fig. 4). The presence of other lead nuclides may be demonstrated by observing the ingrowth of the bismuth activity and comparing the shape of the normalised curve with the curve in Fig. 4. using an arbitrary scale of activity proportional to the existing ordinate.",
