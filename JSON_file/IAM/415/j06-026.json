    "text": "In view of its well-known normal migration, the occurrence of Calanus finmarchicus in the summer at the surface in bright sunlight may justly be considered anomalous. This phenomenon has nevertheless been recorded many times, and such surface Calanus may be present in enormous numbers, breaking the surface into small circular ripples like raindrops. Observed underwater, two zones of differing behavior were recognized: an upper one about 30 cm in depth, in which the Calanus swam up and down repeatedly, frequently bumping on the undersurface of the water, and a lower one of indeterminate depth in which animals swam directly up or down.",
