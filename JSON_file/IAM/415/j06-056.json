    "text": "Loeb first suggested the importance of light as the governing factor but combined its influence with that of gravity. Later authors, in particular Rose, have proposed that light alone can provide an adequate mechanism if the animals have, and select by exploration, a zone of optimum light intensity. This view has been enlarged with a suggestion that both phototaxes and geotaxes may play a part in keeping animals near their optimum.",
