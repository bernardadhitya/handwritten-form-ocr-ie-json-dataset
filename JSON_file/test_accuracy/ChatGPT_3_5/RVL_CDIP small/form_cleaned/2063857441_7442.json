    "Address": "400 7th Street; S.W. Room PL-401 Washington, 20590",
    "Docket No": "35119349880",
    "Topic": "Smoking in Airports",
    "Comments": "DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke access from the terminal entrance to the aircraft free from exposure to smoke, perhaps by using closed carts that take the passenger through the airport opposite smoke, would provide sufficient protection. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
    "Areas of Concern": {
        "Smoking Areas": "Are there areas of the airport terminal that passengers, including those sensitive to tobacco smoke, frequently must use while traveling, and they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke?",
        "Other Areas": "If yes, explain why these areas are important and why smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted."
    },
    "Recommendation": "Should smoking be allowed anywhere in the airport or should there be designated smoking areas? Why?",
