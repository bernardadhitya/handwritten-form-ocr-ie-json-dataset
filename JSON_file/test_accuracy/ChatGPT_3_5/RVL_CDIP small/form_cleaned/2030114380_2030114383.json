Shut down equipment by normal stopping procedure and ensure equipment has come to a complete stop. Lock out/tag out the following potentially hazardous energy sources per Park 500 Lockout Policy. See attachment for energy isolation locations. Electrical disconnects shall be in the 'OFF' position, locked and tagged with supplied locking device. This provides positive means to physically isolate energy from the equipment. Electrical energy should be isolated from the equipment to prevent shock or death that could result from frayed or exposed wiring. Always stand to the side and look away from properly grounded wiring when activating on/off switch. Unauthorized tampering with the switch will involve potential energized electrical circuits. Exposure should electrical arc occur."
