    "ABSTRACT": "HPLC using 8-cyclodextrin bonded phases examined for the enantiomeric resolution of racemic nicotine and nicotine analogues. Ten pairs of enantiomers successfully separated using this technique. This represents the first reported facile and direct separation of these racemates. Effects of pH, mobile phase composition, structural features of the substrates (i.e. substituent size and position, presence of pyrrolidine, hydrogen bonding functionalities, basicity), retention, and enantioselectivity are discussed.",
