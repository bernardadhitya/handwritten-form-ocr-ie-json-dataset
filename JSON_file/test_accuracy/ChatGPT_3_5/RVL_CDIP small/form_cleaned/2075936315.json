    "Abstract": "This paper will review the historical development of our understanding of the chemistry and physics of cigarette smoke since the first Tobacco Chemists Research Conference. We will begin by recreating the state of knowledge in the mid-1940s. Then, emphasizing the contribution of TCRC, critical papers and reviews will be cited to show how our understanding of smoke formation and behavior has progressed. Special attention will be given to the value and pitfalls of pyrolysis experiments, aerosol properties, and the shift from smoke formation concepts to detailed explanations on the micro processes and environments occurring in cigarettes.",
