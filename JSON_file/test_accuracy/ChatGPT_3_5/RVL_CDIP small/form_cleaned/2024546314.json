  "abstract": "The research reported here investigated the effects of antagonism of chronic nicotine administration on lever pressing by rats maintained under a multiple fixed-ratio fixed-interval (MULR FR FI) schedule of food presentation. Twenty-four male rats were trained under a multiple schedule until responding was stable. The rats were anesthetized and an osmotic minipump filled with (-)-nicotine was inserted subcutaneously between the scapulae. Nicotine was infused subcutaneously at doses of 3 mg/kg, 12 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg. After 240 hours of continuous nicotine infusion, the rats were challenged with the nicotinic-cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine. Blood samples (450-1000 µl) were collected from the dorsal digital vein in the hind paw under ether anesthesia the day before and the day after the mecamylamine challenge. Characteristic performance was maintained under the MULR FR FI schedule. FI rates were significantly decreased on the first day and remained stable throughout the remainder of the nicotine phase. FR rates also were decreased on day 1 of nicotine exposure but this effect failed to achieve statistical significance. Beginning on day 3, FR rates were significantly elevated. Chronic nicotine treatment increased FR rates from 1.16 ± 0.12 during control sessions to 1.42 ± 0.13 responses per second during nicotine sessions. The mecamylamine challenge significantly decreased FR response rate, relative to the last three days of nicotine. However, this decrease was not significantly different from control values. FI performance was not altered during the mecamylamine challenge. Multiple form detection analysis showed that levels of nicotine challenge were similar and that the blood levels were mg/ml blood. These results show that blocking nicotine's central nervous system actions following chronic nicotine treatment does result in a disruption of schedule-controlled performance.",
