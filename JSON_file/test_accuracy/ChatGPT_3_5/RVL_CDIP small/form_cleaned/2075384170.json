    "Abstract": "Chemiluminescence detection of nitric oxide using the Sievers Model 280 NOA Nitric Oxide Analyzer has been used successfully for the analysis of nitrate and nitroso containing compounds (including tobacco-specific Acnnmosamines) in tobacco in the per-billion range. Treating aqueous tobacco extracts with vanadium (III) chloride quantitatively produces nitric oxide from nitrate and nitrite. Similarly, treatment with potassium iodide quantitatively reduces nitrite, but not nitrate, to nitric oxide. Group analysis of compounds containing the nitroso group can also be achieved by the sample technique. To do so, tobacco extracts were treated with cuprous chloride acid to release nitric oxide from nitroso-containing compounds including A-nitrosamines. The mechanism of reaction, the relative reactivities of various nitrosamines towards the reagent, and the elimination of interference of nitrate and nitrite in the analysis will be described and discussed.",
