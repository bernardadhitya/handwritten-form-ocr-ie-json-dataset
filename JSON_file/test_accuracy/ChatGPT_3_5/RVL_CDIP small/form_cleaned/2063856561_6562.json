    "Comments": {
        "Suggestion": "DOT has suggested guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke access from the terminal entrance to the aircraft free from exposure to tobacco smoke, perhaps by a closed cart",
        "Question": "Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
        "Other Areas": "Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers, including those sensitive to tobacco smoke, frequently visit and where they need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g. restrooms, telephone booths, baggage claim, newsstands, ticket counters, etc.)? If yes, explain why these areas are important for travelers and why smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted."
