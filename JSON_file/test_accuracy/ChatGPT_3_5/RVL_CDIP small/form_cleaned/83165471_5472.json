        "content": "Statistical analysis was used to determine the composition and blend homogeneity in the production blends of cut strip tobacco. The instrument developed using principal samples of reconstituted leaf and various tobaccos were analyzed separately to identify the different tobacco types. A calibration model was developed using tobacco test mixtures that were blended as cut samples, showing predictions within 1.29% accuracy of the actual compositions. Analytical results will be presented to illustrate the accuracy of the NRR instrumentation.",
