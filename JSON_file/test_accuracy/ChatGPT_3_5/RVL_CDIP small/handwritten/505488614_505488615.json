        "Content": "Your suit with McKenzie Associates on behalf of Vincent Hanard due to cigarette smoking is ludicrous in so much as his family said he did not know the dangers of smoking. Has he been going around with blinders on? No willpower. Beer is harmful, liquor is harmful, too much fat is harmful, but if you are not willing to stay away from all of these goodies then suffer the consequences. This whole country is a suit and I hope they throw them all out along with lawyer Melvin haes85. Kno 18 parasite living in the misery of others. He has a suit in the paper today Miami Herald showing he will win this time. I hope not for there will be thousands who will be approached by ambulance chasers like Belli. When my husband died, I had children, the youngest 13, had to take second ing-tga98681 on MY house. Hospitalization insurance was not a popular thing in and the bills were heavy. However, I went to work though I was stricken with Multiple Sclerosis and we made out with the Lord's help. You have a warning posted about smoking on each pack. Some folks don't want to read it. I have friends who like to smoke (not me) and refuse to give it up. They enjoy it just like the who likes his cocktail, but don't try to tell the public 'he already knows the dangers of smoking'. I don't agree with smoking. None of my children smoke. They saw their father die of this but they learned of the dangers in 1964 when he died and took a lesson from it. I'm addicted to cookies. Should I sue Nabisco? I hope the Judge can see Belli, McKenzie Associates are the parasites who are the ones who profit from these suits and they will bring thousands and get rich quick. I'm glad you did not settle with the Galbraith of Stanton, CA. Let Belli and his ilk sweat it out."
