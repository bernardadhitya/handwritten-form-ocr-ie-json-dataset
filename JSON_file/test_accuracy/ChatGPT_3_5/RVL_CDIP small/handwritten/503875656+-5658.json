    "summary": "Data generated has indicated that several factors involved in influencing filtration efficiency. These factors include Sire Velocity, Denier Per Filament, Total denier, filament Surface Area, and Surface Characteristics. The physical processes of smoke filtration occur primarily by three mechanisms: Direct Interception, Brownian Diffusion, and Inertial Impaction. Research has shown that Diffusion accounts for approximately two-thirds of particulate filtration, while Direct Interception accounts for the majority of the remainder of filtration. Inertial Impaction plays a very minor role, contributing less than five percent of filtration. Studies relating smoke velocity to filtration efficiency have shown varying results from several different angles. Experiments involving puff operations and puff volume constants, as well as experiments where puff volumes were varied while holding puff duration constant, have shown that lowering smoke velocity can increase filtration efficiency by diffusion, increasing the length of time that particulates are available for diffusion. Denier Per Filament (DPF) and Total Denier correlate with the weight and distribution of individual fiber, affecting the efficiency of the filter material. The physical and chemical nature of the filter material and the size and distribution of fibers play a significant role in filter efficiency. Filters with high DPF have high filter efficiency due to the increased number of individual fibers providing more surface area for Direct Interception.",
