    "Body": "Dear Sir, I have received your letter. Has it been a good time since we last spoke? I am curious about the issue with the packages of cigarettes. I think that every package of cigarettes should have a warning label. I believe that it would be very hard to implement ads which are not completely truthful, for instance, the issue with your younger consumers who smoke. One of the concerns is that this could lead to an increase in cancer cases. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Dan Dabatrom"
