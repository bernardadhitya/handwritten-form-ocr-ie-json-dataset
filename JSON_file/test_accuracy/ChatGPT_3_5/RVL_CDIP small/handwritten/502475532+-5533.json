I lit one up and drew very hard. I noticed it was fastened through the paper. Thinking of this, I disposed of it and lit another. Before I got to my second cigarette, there was some wax on your instructions. There was a kind of new one in the pack, I am being cautious because the nicotine on the S lter is not securely sealed. Following your instructions, there was a kind of new one in the pack, I am being cautious because the nicotine on the S lter is not securely sealed. Chewing actions dismay at the department also."
