    "Message": "I think that it's a great idea to put warnings on packages. I think that it's too bad people abuse the men they see. I noticed that the warning is very small. Couldn't you make the warning a little more eye-catching? I know that you make the warning smaller because you'll sell more, but I think that all you have to do is make the warning in a brighter color than black. Thank you for your time.",
