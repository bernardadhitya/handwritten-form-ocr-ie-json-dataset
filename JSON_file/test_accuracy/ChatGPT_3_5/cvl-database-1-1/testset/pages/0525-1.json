    "text": "Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about on the surface but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows only hard and with luminous edges, and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years ago, I should have said universe, but now my mind has been opened to higher views of a vast sheet on which straight lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, and other figures move freely about, without rising above or sinking below, very much like shadows only hard with luminous edges. And you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen.",
