It has a crushed blue velvet cloth top around the glass until the top of the bar. We have purchased what we bought like the Camel towel, Comeltin license plate, and little ashtray. We are strong about purchasing soon. L. Carmel can get it. Recently purchased a Camel clock. The bar is completely finished. We need to purchase a refrigerator.",
