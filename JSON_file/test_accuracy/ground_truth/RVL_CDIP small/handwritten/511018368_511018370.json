        "erroneous_legal_view": "Because of an erroneous legal view of coumarin, a proposal was made to ban it worldwide.",
        "classification": "This classification is based on controversial results with high doses that could not be confirmed by a committee of functional pathologists. Rather, the malformations involve cholangiomas and minimal/malignant proliferations; the Salamaw experiment.",
        "metastasis": "Beyond that, no metastasis has been observed.",
        "studies": "Three different studies established an anti-carcinogenic activity of coumarin. Coumarin exhibited some teratogenic activity.",
        "mechanism": "If we aggregate the different degradation mechanisms of coumarin in various animals in comparison with man, for example, coumarin with complete excretion within 3 hours and with differing 2-hydroxycoumarin, which are essentially terminated for its hepatotoxic activity, then there are no effective liver lifts.",
        "inhalation_studies": "Studies of the effect of coumarin by smoke inhalation did not produce any results, since the amount of coumarin transferred to smoke was permissible amounts."
