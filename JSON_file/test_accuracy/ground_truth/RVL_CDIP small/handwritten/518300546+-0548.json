        "greeting": "Dear Sir",
        "body": "I'm writing this letter to inform you that I've been smoking Winston cigarettes for a very long time. Just recently purchased a carton of Winston Select Full Flavor cigarettes and every pack in the carton was stale. Up until now I must say I was one of your better customers. I'm what you might call a Winston woman. I hope that this doesn't happen anymore. I feel that I wasted money that I worked very hard for. I would appreciate it if the company would try to take care of this problem.",
        "closing": "Thank you for your time.",
