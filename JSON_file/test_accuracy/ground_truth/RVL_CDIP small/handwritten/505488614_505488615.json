    "salutation": "Gentlemen",
    "body": "Your suit with Mckenzie & Associates on behalf of Vincent Hanard due to cigarette smoking is ludicrous, in so much as his family said he did not know 'the dangers of smoking'. Has he been going around with blinders on? My husband died at the age of 61 with Emphysema and that was in 1964. He had been smoking 2 to 3 packs of Camels a day. When he learned of the dangers associated with smoking in 1963 and it surely was well publicized he quit. If Mr. Hanard did not know in the early 60's of this he must have been going around with blinders on. No willpower. Beer is harmful, liquor is harmful, too much fat is harmful, then suffer the consequences. out along with lawyer Melvin Belli who is a parasite living on the saying he will win this time. I hope not for there will be thousands who will be approached by xxxx 'ambulance chasers' like Belli. When my husband died I had 4 children, the youngest 13. I had to take a second mortgage on my house, hospitalization insurance was not a popular thing in 1964 and the bills were heavy. However I went to work though I was stricken with Multiple Sclerosis, and we made out with the Lord's help. You have a warning posted about smoking on each pack. Some folks don't WANT to read. I have friends who like to smoke (not me) and refuse to give it up. They enjoy it, just like the guy who likes his cocktail, but don't try to tell the public 'he didn't know the dangers of smoking'. I don't agree with smoking. None of my children smoke. They saw their father die of this but they learned of the dangers in 1964 when he died and took a lesson from it. I'm addicted to cookies. Should I sue Nabisco? I hope the Judge can see Belli, Mckenzie & Associates, are the parasites who are the ones who profit from these suits and they will bring thousands and 'get rich quick'. I'm glad you did not settle with the Galbraiths of Stanton, CA. Let Belli and his ilk sweat it out.",
    "closing": "Jane B. O'Connor"
