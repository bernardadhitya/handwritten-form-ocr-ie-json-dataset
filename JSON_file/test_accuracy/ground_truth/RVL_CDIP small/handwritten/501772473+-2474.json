    "content": "I saw in newspapers of cigarette smokers claiming cigarette smoking caused cancer of their lungs and have sued some tobacco companies for damages. I do not believe any such suits will be decided in favor of the cigarette smokers because of the fact medical science does not yet know the real cause of cancer, but in my case of irritated lungs caused by having smoked Camel cigarettes can easily be proven and I have an X-ray picture made of my chest that will back up any other proof that smoking Camel cigarettes or some ingredient in the smoke therefrom irritated both has been of damage to my life and health, wife and son to an amount beyond me being able to estimate in dollars. Since 1948 my lungs became irritated to the extent I had smothering spells and could not work, so then consulted one of the most noted physicians and surgeons."
