    "body": "To Whom it May Concern: I am writing in reference to your so-called 'Free Carton' Doral offer. Instead of receiving our e-coupon, we are now receiving a ten-dollar coupon. Doral's for 10.00. Your 'Free Carton Offer' is clearly false advertising. My husband and I are upset about this. Between us, we smoke close to 3 cartons a week. I called your 1-800 number and had our names removed from your mailing list. At least once a month we get offers from just about every other cigarette company. We will now consider these. We have enough Doral pack seals to send for your offer, but we will change our brand.",
