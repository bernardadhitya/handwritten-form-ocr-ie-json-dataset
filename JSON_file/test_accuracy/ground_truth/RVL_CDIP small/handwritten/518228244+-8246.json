    "ToWhomItMayConcern": "Although I have no complaint about the taste of your Dorol brand, certainly better than 'name brands', I do have other concerns. Since your cigarettes are so loosely packed, they are not truly '100's' as purported. Also, and this is my major concern, since they are so loosely packed, half falls off very easily and sometimes goes unnoticed."
