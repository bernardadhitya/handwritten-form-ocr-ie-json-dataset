  "text": "Table 1 shows the decontamination factors obtained experimentally for ten radionu clides, accompanied in two instances by radioactive daughters. The decontamination factor falls below 104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95 with their daughters in the first stage,i.e. the lead chraining the bismuth-210 daughter When the second stage (the bismuth phosphate source) is completed, the decontam-ination factors are exceptionally high.
