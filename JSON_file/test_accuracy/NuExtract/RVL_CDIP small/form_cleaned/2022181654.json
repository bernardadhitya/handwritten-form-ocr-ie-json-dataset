  "abstract": "HPLc using -cyclodextrin bonded phases was examined for the enan- tiomeric separation of racemic nicotine and 19 racemic nicotine analogues. Ten pairs of enantiomers were successfully separated using this technique. This represents the first reported facile and direct separation of these racemates. Effects of ph, mobile phase composition, and structural features of the substrates (i.e., substituent size and position and size of substituents, presence of pyrrolidine ring or hydrogen bonding functionalities, basicity) on the retention and enantioselectivity are discussed.",
