Effects of ph, mobile phase composition, and structural features of the substrates (i.e., substituent size and posit...\nstituents, presence of pyrrolidine ring or hydrogen bonding functionalities, basicity) on the retention and enantioselectivity are discussed.\n2022181654 PATENT STATUS:.Applied for Patented Not Filed No Interest INTERNAL REFEREES:\nM.R.B.COORDINATOR:\nCGL/4-84/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
