    "content": "Previously, I smoked Winston for a long time because of the low tar and light flavor. I was convinced that it was better for tar and nicotine regulation. Recently, I have returned cartons and packages to the store for replacement. What is that horrible mildew smell? Is it a new process the cartons brought? Yesterday it stank. Now today brought some new ones. I can't continue running back and forth to the store to exchange cigarettes. Most places are out of stock locally.",
