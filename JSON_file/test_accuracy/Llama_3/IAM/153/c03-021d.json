  "text": "In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an old man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged from women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn child as much as to the expectant mother, who acts as a protector and comforter to her in her hour of need. He shares her room and gives her his forlorn gift of companionship and sympathy -\"you need someone to love you while you are looking for someone to love\".",
