  "text": "Mailufterl is an Austrian nickname for the first computer working solely on transistors on the European mainland. It was built in 1955 at the Vienna University of Technology by Heinz Zemanek. The builder plays on a quote on an operating computer: \"If it is not the rapid calculation speed of American models that Whirlwind or Typhoon can achieve, it will be enough for a Wiener Mailufterl\". The full name is Binar dezimaler Volltransistor-Rechenautomat.",
