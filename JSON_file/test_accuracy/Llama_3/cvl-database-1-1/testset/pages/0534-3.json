  "text": "Mailufterl is an Austrian nickname for the first computer working solely on transistors on the European mainland. It was built in 1955 at the Vienna University of Technology by Heinz Zemanek. The builder plays on a quote on an operating computer: \"If it is not the rapid calculation speed of American models that Whirlwind or Typhoon can achieve, it will be enough for a Wiener Mailufterl\". The full name is Binar dezimaler Volltransistor-Rechenautomat.\nMoi|vfton1 i5on Avstaion\nnickrolme fomthe fiMst Co py[\nWonKinq\nopu qtin y computer: ifitis roth Wener MgiF toyl\" fh.\nndme in BindM olezm le1 V\nReuh lnauTomat",
