However, we can identify the structured information as follows:\n- Brand name: \"Qopa Gvararrecs PRensum Tacre\"\n- Legal approval number: \"1X48 Mire Gaevenre Exreucser\"\n- Date: \"ANITIALS DATE\"\n- Comments: \"COMMENTS\"\n- Approval requirements: \"ADVERTISING COMP\" and \"ADVERTISING LEGAL STATS\"\n- Originator: \"ARsy_OMEHL fra Jj ORIGINATOR\"\n- Approval levels: \"BRAND MANAGER\", \"MARKETING DIRECTOR\", \"LAW DEPARTMENT\", \"VICE PRESIDENT BRAND MARKETING/ NEW BRANDS\", \"SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT\", and \"EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT\"\n\n## Step 2: Convert the structured information into JSON format\nBased on the identified structured information, we can create the following JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"brand_name\": \"Qopa Gvararrecs PRensum Tacre\",\n  \"legal_approval_number\": \"1X48 Mire Gaevenre Exreucser\",\n  \"date\": \"ANITIALS DATE\",\n  \"comments\": \"COMMENTS\",\n  \"approval_requirements\":"
