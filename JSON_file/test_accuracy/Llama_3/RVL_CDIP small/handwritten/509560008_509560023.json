Tasker. apt. of Pashatincn nel Human —Develappuatt_-shihegon Stehe-U., E.Lawsuig....(1) \n\nThe Quercetin, a flavonoid found in many plants, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In a study conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, quercetin was found to have a positive effect on the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in rat glial cells. The researchers used a combination of quercetin and a chemical inhibitor of gap junctions, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), to study the effects of quercetin on GJIC. The results showed that quercetin reversed the inhibition of GJIC caused by TPA.\n\n**Results:**\n\n* Quercetin increased the expression of connexin 43, a protein that plays a key role in GJIC.\n* Quercetin increased the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between rat glial cells.\n* Quercetin reversed the inhibition of GJIC caused by TPA.\n* Quercetin had no significant effect on the expression of connexin 43 in human glial cells.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n"
