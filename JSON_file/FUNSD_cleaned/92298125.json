    "message": "Here is yet another version of the questionnaire. Please note that the last 2 pages are the alternate versions that we discussed. Take a look at the alternate Q9 to try to get at the intensity issue, and maybe we can improve on it from here. By the way, we received 13 more signature cards today and sent the cigarettes out. We are now up to 74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopefully we will get a lot of callbacks this weekend. Talk to you Monday. Thanks.",
