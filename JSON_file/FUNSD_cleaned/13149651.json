Smoking within these buildings would be allowed only in specified facilities or rooms, provided. It is estimated that, on the average, university buildings would each estimated at $4.50 in 1982-83 dollars. This estimate is based on the 1981 per sign cost and increased to reflect inflation from 1981 to 1983. Thus, the expected one-time cost for the University System to implement the provisions of the bill would be about $8,000. There are no significant continuing annual costs associated with the bill's provisions.",
