Could be quite radical - do we need entirely different production techniques? Maybe it is better business either to modify cigarette specifications to modify tobacco as presented (for homogeneity of manufactured product) and that might be a conclusion reached with field production people concentrating on maximizing productivity within wide physical and chemical parameters. These currently grey areas need resolution. Emphasis at first is to know more what others have to offer than say what we need to know."
