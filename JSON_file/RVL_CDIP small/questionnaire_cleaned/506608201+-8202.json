I'd like to briefly tell you what it would mean if the proposal becomes law. In Howard County workplaces, smoking would be banned in reception areas, employee dressing rooms and even employee lounges or cafeterias. Smoking would be banned in banks, public restrooms, meeting halls, theater lobbies and in enclosed bus or train shelters. And in bowling alleys, hotel lobbies, barber shops, hair salons and common areas of shopping malls, smokers would be herded into designated smoking areas. Designated smoking areas would also be mandatory in restaurants that seat 75 or more customers. Restaurant owners would have no choice. And if you violate the law you could be fined or even arrested!"
