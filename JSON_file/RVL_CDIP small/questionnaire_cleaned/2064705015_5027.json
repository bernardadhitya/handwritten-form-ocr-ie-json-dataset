                    "question": "Are you saying this is a safer cigarette?",
                    "answer": "The US government has determined that there is no such thing as a safe cigarette, and we would not say this is a safe or safer cigarette unless the government determined that was so. The package and all advertising for the new smoking system will carry one of the four federally mandated health warnings that are not compatible with the belief that the new cigarette is safe."

                    "question": "If you have this technology, why not apply it to all of your cigarettes?",
                    "answer": "It is not yet technologically feasible to use this new heat source embodied in the lighter with any cigarette other than the cigarette specially designed to be smoked in the Puff Activated Lighter. However, this design may just be the beginning. There may be further advancements down the road that will enable us to provide our consumers with other products that can be used with the lighter."

                    "question": "What is the 1R4F Kentucky Reference Cigarette that was used? What PM brands currently on the market would it be comparable to?",
                    "answer": "The 1R4F is the reference cigarette closest to the most common cigarettes demanded by the US marketplace, including Philip Morris cigarettes. It is based on the sales-weighted average of the tar and nicotine delivery as measured by the FTC method, of brands currently on the market. Kentucky Reference Cigarettes are standard reference cigarettes used for biological testing and smoke chemistry studies. They were developed by the University of Kentucky and are for sale to laboratories by the University. There is no comparable PM brand on the market."

                {
                    "question": "Is this the direction your company is headed in lowering the levels of these smoke constituents?",
                    "answer": "The tar delivery of cigarettes is determined by consumer preference and demand. This is why the deliveries of tar and nicotine in cigarettes currently on the market, when measured by the FTC method, are the lowest ever. We will always try to be responsive to concerns raised from the scientific community regarding specific smoke constituents."
