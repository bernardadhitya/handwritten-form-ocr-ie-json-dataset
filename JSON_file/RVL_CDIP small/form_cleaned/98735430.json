        "description": "Continuing thru on or about April 9, 1998 excepting approximately 36 days in November/December of 1997 while housed in SHU at F.C.I. Big Spring, Texas where I was assigned during this time period, I was exposed daily to 'secondhand smoke' in the housing unit I lived in which was Sunrise Unit. Although the housing units were off limits to smoking, many inmates would violate this rule daily. Those inmates who did go outside, congregated at the exit/entrance doors further exposing me to 'secondhand smoke' almost every time I walked in or out of the unit. This problem was remedied by the Warden in SHU by not allowing cigarettes sold to inmates while housed there, yet inmates in the general population could easily buy cigarettes inmates like myself in our living quarters which was only due to negligence by BOP staff."

I am a nonsmoker and have never smoked."
