    "abstract": "Evidence is presented that in the copyrolysis of carbohydrates and inorganic sulfur compounds, carbonyl sulfide is formed from the decomposition of thioacetic acid. This acid is proposed as an intermediate from the reaction of ketene and hydrogen sulfide. Ketene is a decomposition product of carbohydrates. Hydrogen sulfide is derived from the reaction of sulfur and alkanes. The latter compounds result from the degradation of the carbohydrates.",
