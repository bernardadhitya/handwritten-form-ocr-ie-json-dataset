We are thinking that a trip of INBIFO folks to check out at least three machines and train TRI and KC personnel might best be scheduled for 9/7-9/12, based on schedules from Henry. In order to do this effectively, the items on the attached list should be considered. In particular, number 4 seems essential for training purposes, and would be more effective if it could be made available to participants prior to the training session. Does this seem like a reasonable plan? I plan to call on Wednesday, 8/25, to discuss details, but wanted you to have time to think about it before then. Thank you!",
