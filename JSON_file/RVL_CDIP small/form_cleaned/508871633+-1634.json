        "description": "Eight unopened and one opened pack manufactured during shift 8 in February 1988 at #12 coded 1 2 0) were returned along with two butts which were deeply stained blue/black. The complaint was that, while the smoker was preoccupied with TV, one of those cigarettes was smoked which stained the smoker's mouth and fingers.",
        "examination": "Examination of the butts leads to the conclusions that the source of the blue color was neither from within the filter plug nor from the tobacco rod but was the result of an external application to the tipping and/or cigarette paper.",
        "analysis": "The dye was extracted along with normal tobacco components and subjected to infrared analysis. The spectra suggested a sodium azo-sulfonate dye. An example of such a compound would be methyl blue, which is used medicinally as an antiseptic.",
        "speculation": "We cannot speculate on the origin of such a substance on the cigarettes in question."
