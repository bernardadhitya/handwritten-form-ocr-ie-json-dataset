            "question": "DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke 'a path of access from the terminal to the airport without exposure to smoke,' would provide sufficient protection. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
            "response": "The least expensive and most effective solution is to ban smoking in the airports. Smokers cost this nation enough and probably more than we will ever know."

            "question": "Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers - including those sensitive to tobacco smoke frequently must use while traveling, and where they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g., restrooms, telephones, eating areas, baggage claim, news stands and other stores, ticket counters, etc.)? If yes, explain why these areas are important to travelers, and what smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted.",
            "response": "Prohibition of smoking in airports, as outlined."
