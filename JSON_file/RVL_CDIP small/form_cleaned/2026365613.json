        "description": "This invention employs the use of B-diketones to form dihydropyridines and pyridines. Reaction of acetylacetone with ethyl B-amino crotonate for example would generate 2,4,6-triethyl nicotinic acid and 2,4,6-trimethyl nicotinates. These would be important for formation of 2,4,6-trimethyl nicotines. Other B-diketones and substituted B-amino crotonates would yield 2,4,6-trialkylnicotinic acids and their esters for formations of 2,4,6-trialkyl nicotines which could be converted to 2,4,6-trialkylnicotines by known paths.",
        "state_of_the_art": "2,4,6-trialkyl nicotinates, 2,4,6-trialkyl nicotinic acids, and 2,4,6-trialkylnicotines are unknown. All should have important biological activity.",
