    "proposedWork": "This is a long term study of the effects of cigarette smoking and cessation on smokers and non-smokers of comparable ages. In this study, initial measurements of lung volumes, mechanics of breathing, gas distribution in the lung, and diffusion will be determined in about 25 non-smokers, 25 smokers who will quit smoking, and 25 smokers who are not willing to change their smoking habits. They will then be followed with repeated studies at frequent intervals for about 3 years to assess the pulmonary effects of smoking and increase our understanding of the mechanism by which cigarette smoking alters lung function as well as give useful information about the progression and reversibility of these changes.",
