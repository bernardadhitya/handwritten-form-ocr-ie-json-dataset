        "summary": "Nicotine concentrations were determined in passenger cabins of B727 and B737 aircraft during domestic flights to assess the effectiveness of smoker segregation in minimizing non-smokers' exposure to ETS. Sampling systems with constant flow pumps and sorbent tubes containing XAD-4 resin collected integrated samples of nicotine. Systems were concealed in briefcases to ensure unobtrusive sampling. Analysis involved desorption of nicotine into ethyl acetate and quantification with gas chromatography and nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Twenty-three samples were acquired in smoking sections and thirty-nine samples in no-smoking sections at the boundaries with smoking sections. In no-smoking boundary sections, nicotine concentrations ranged from 0 to 40 \u00b5g/m3 with an arithmetic mean of 11 \u00b5g/m3. In smoking sections, nicotine concentrations ranged from 0 to 112 \u00b5g/m3 with an arithmetic mean of 23 \u00b5g/m3. Sampling times ranged from 13 to 179 minutes with an arithmetic mean of 57 minutes. Results indicate that no-smoking sections are essentially ETS-free for aircraft such as B727's and B737's, which have 'once-through' ventilation systems."
