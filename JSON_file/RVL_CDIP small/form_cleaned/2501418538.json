        "abstract_text": "It is generally assumed that nicotine can be absorbed into the systemic circulation by non-inhaling cigar smokers but not by non-inhaling cigarette smokers. The experiments to be described show that plasma nicotine levels increase by only very small amounts (of the order of 1-2 ng/ml) from either form of smoking, when absorption is only possible from the buccal cavity and nasopharynx. The reason for this is believed to be the short contact time that normal smoking allows for the smoke to be in contact with target organs. When compared with the lungs, this route offers a relatively inefficient pathway to the systemic circulation.",
