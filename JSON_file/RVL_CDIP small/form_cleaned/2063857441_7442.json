                "question": "DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke a path of access from the terminal to the airport without exposure to smoke, would provide sufficient protection. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
                "response": "Disagree. A closed cart would not be a substitute for a smoke-free airport. Walking through smokers clustered makes me sick. I hate the intermissions because you can't get out without going through a smoke screen. This would be the same."
            },
            "section_2": {
                "question": "Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers - including those sensitive to tobacco smoke frequently must use while traveling, and where they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g., restrooms, telephones, eating areas, baggage claim, news stands and other stores, ticket counters, etc.)? If yes, explain why these areas are important to travelers, and what smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted.",
                "response": "Yes, the entire airport because the smoke can deter some. Smoking areas are too close to the eating areas, just too tasteless. Baggage area air conditioning spreads smoke smell. It does not remove or mask the smell."
