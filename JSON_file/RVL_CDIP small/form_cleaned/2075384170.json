        "Abstract": "Chemiluminescence detection of nitric oxide, using the Sievers Model 280 NOATM Nitric Oxide Analyzer, has been used successfully for the analysis of nitrate, nitrite, and nitroso-containing compounds (including tobacco specific N-nitrosamines) in tobacco in the parts-per-billion range. Treating aqueous tobacco extracts with vanadium (III) chloride in acid quantitatively produces nitric oxide from nitrate (and nitrite). Similarly, treatment with potassium iodide quantitatively reduces nitrite, but not nitrate, to nitric oxide. Group analysis of compounds containing the nitroso group can also be achieved by the same technique. To do so, tobacco extracts were treated with cuprous chloride in acid to release nitric oxide from nitroso-containing compounds, including V-nitrosamines. The mechanism of that reaction, the relative reactivities of various nitrosamines towards the reagent, and the elimination of interference of nitrate and nitrite to the analysis will be described and discussed.",
