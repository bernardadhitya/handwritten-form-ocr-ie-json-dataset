Twenty each of regular WINSTON and regular Marlboro smokers will be used for each test. Cigarettes will be obtained from samples used in NFO tests. A baseline test in which cigarettes from the most recent NFO test practical will be used, is to be conducted as soon as possible. Further tests will be made on cigarettes from subsequent mailouts only if the NFO test result warrants. Samples will be retained from each mailout, pending their need in a smoking test. Results from NFO and smoking characteristic measurements will be compared to identify links which could lead to improvement of WINSTON versus Marlboro.",
