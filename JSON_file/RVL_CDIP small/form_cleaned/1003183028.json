    "abstract": "A previously unreported compound, 2,3-dimethyl-6-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (solanoquinone) was isolated from tobacco and smoke by a combination of liquid-liquid partitioning, column chromatography, preparative tlc, and gas chromatography. Solanoquinone was first isolated from a low alkaloid bright lamina and was identified by use of ir, uv, NR, and ms. The compound was synthesized by a Diels-Alder reaction of neophytadiene with 2,3-dimethylbenzoquinone, resulting in a product which was identical to the isolated solanoquinone. Quantitation of solanoquinone in tobacco and smoke was accomplished with a rapid procedure using preparative tlc followed by gc. The amount of solanoquinone in a sample of flue-cured lamina was found to be 2000 times higher than the amount in an uncured sample from the same crop which was freeze-dried after harvest.",
