Previous testing SED #1235 of Now 85 prototypes which employed sTT filters did not indicate a perceptual effect of the sTr filter. It was hypothesized that the vent hole placement used on the prototypes precluded any effect of the STT filter. The results of this study will be used by the xB product development team in the development of XB prototypes, and by Brands R&D in the development of Now prototypes.",
