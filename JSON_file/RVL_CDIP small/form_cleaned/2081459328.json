You will note that the method of assessment collection is detailed as we have permission from USDA to add collection enforcement into our Standard Auction Warehouse Contract. Please keep this Agreement confidential. If details are discussed at next Tuesday's Tobacco Industry Leadership Group meeting, it will more than likely be the draft proposal, which is discussed. We need your answer as to whether or not your company intends to participate no later than Monday. Details of this Agreement can be finalized with Arnold Hamm or myself. Sincerely, Lioniel Edwards",
