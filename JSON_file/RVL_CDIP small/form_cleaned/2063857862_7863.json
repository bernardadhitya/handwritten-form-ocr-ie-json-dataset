            "question": "DOT has suggested that guaranteeing passengers sensitive to tobacco smoke 'a path of access from the terminal entrance to the aircraft free from exposure to tobacco smoke,' perhaps by using 'an enclosed cart that took the passenger through the airport without exposure to smoke, would provide sufficient protection. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
            "response": "DISAGREE",
            "reason": "SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK FROM A TO B WITHOUT EXPOSURE TO SMOKE AND BEING HINDERED IN ISOLATION IN A CART SIMPLY FROM AIRPORTS"

            "question": "Are there other areas of the airport terminal that passengers - including those sensitive to tobacco smoke - frequently must use while traveling, and where they therefore need protection from exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g., restrooms, telephones, eating areas, baggage claim, news stands and other stores, ticket counters, etc.) If yes, explain why these areas are important to travelers, and what smoking restrictions (if any) should be adopted.",
            "response": "VERY IMPORTANT",
            "reason": "ALL PUBLIC FACILITIES A SMOKE-FREE TRAVELER HAS HAVE ADMIN AT BE IN A SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT."
