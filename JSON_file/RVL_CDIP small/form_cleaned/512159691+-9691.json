    "Subject": "TOW CHANGE FOR CAMEL WIDES LIGHTS (to 2.0/35000)",
    "Background": "The current tow item for CAMEL WIDES Lights is 2.1/48000). It is a small quantity tow item for RJR and the last shipment received was of extremely low yield which would result in low cigarette drafts/high tars. Since replacement 2.1/48000 will not be available in time, and since 2.0/35000 offers a satisfactory solution, it is recommended to switch to 2.0/35000. Testing has been done with 2.0/35000 in conjunction with by-product utilization for future implementation.",
    "Risk_Assessment": "Extremely low risk since 2.0/35000 has been tested at a tip draft matching the current",
    "Recommendation": "Switch to 2.0/35000 at a tip draft matching the current target.",
