            "summary": "Prof. Beidler is the world's leading authority on the biophysical mechanisms of oral perception. With RJR support he has been studying the binding of nicotine to salivary proteins, the role of tissue retention in aftertaste, the stimulation of different salivary glands with natural and pharmacological stimuli and the permeability of epithelia to nicotine as a function of pH. In the present research, Prof. Beidler will determine the effect of levulinic and other acids on the permeability of sensory epithelia from the mouth and nose to nicotine. He will determine if such effects can be explained in terms of the change in pH which each acid produces in the fluid overlying the receptors of the olfactory, trigeminal or gustatory receptors. This research will provide important information for the modification of the sensory properties of nicotine and sensory smoke by the addition of acids to cigarettes."
