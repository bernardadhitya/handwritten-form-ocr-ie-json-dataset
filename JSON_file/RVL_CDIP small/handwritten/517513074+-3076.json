    "message": "Dear Customer Service Rep, In response to the recent flier I received a few days ago which had a coupon attached, I must respond with the following comments. As to your referral of frequent offers of any kind, I haven't received anything pertaining to any item from the Vantage Division. We were terribly disappointed in January of this year when we finally received notification that the promotion wouldn't be sent to us. It did not seem unreasonable to expect delivery of the items requested to be delivered by Christmas since our order was mailed on December 9th, which was just a few days after we received the form. It appeared to be a good way to help offset the costs of Christmas. Wrong again. My wife and I both responded to your recent Vantage offer in the middle of November. My wife received a $10.00 off coupon instead of the carton of Vantage she sent UPCs for. Were you out of cartons of Vantage? I think not. I did finally receive my carton of Vantage, but not until February 9th. Come on, the only thing we expect is that you do what the flier info states that you'll do. When your family is on a budget, you clip coupons and save UPCs, every dollar counts. So when you top it off, the cost of a carton of Vantage usually sells for $15 to $20, a $10.00 off coupon instead of a free carton as ordered isn't accepted very well."
