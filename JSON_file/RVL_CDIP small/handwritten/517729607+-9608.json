I have always received great service from you in the past. I mailed the C notes in a return addressed, sealed manila envelope, so it seems unlikely that it could have been overlooked. My neighbor had a problem with their mail, so maybe that's the answer. It took me quite a while to collect all those C notes. I hate to think it was all for nothing. If you have any information, I would very much appreciate hearing from you. Thank you very much for your attention.",
