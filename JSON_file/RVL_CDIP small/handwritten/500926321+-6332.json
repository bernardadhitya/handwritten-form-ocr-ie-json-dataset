    "content": "The incidence of various diseases, including the medicine of cancer, can be seen from the extensive publications on this subject amounting to more than 100 works. If one examines the overall results, then it becomes evident that society in the broadest sense acts upon the individual through the direct influence of the psychic processes. Social stresses cause individual reactions (demands), leading to an increase in the excitatory level of the hypothalamus and limbic system, an elevated activity of the sympathetic nervous system, an activation of the suprarenal capsule, and hormones. While the catecholamines act primarily upon the blood circulation system, an increase in the retardation of the immunological defense mechanism occurs. Even small effects of the home environment, particularly of psychic and psychosocial nature, show upon the elements of the regulatory system between hypophysis, suprarenal capsule, thymus gland, and germ glands. There is a high probability that this system may also be upset or disturbed, leading to a sharp change of the defense mechanism of the human body against infections and carcinoma. It has been demonstrated that transplanted lung cells are carried out only by the Test Annotated Document."
