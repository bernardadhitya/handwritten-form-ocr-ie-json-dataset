It took me many months to have one. I quit and I hate cigarette smoking. You know what's funny? Well, I remember back in the early months, the enemy gin. Their smoking deals where they had a plastic jingle, she would play. Singing rhymes with my mom, my aunt, and her pack's deals. So well, bye. Smoked nothing but deals since I was 18. All the other brands made me cough. My dad smoked Salems. In memory, we're not your poor family, my mother. Sincerely, Sheila Vosel",
