            "details": "fr CO oxidation with Mn, Cu, or Co oxide. The minus of the oxide is very low. MnO has been shown to oxidize CO at RT but productivity of oxidation will be too low at typical conditions. Spout reactors in conjunction with additional beds (e.g., for 1cm packed bed, GHSV = 12550 hr^-1) compared to 5,000-10,000 hr^-1 for 50% conversion on MnO."

            "details": "CuO, Cu2O have been shown to be active for CO oxidation primarily at temperatures around 200-300\u00b0C. Combination of these oxides with other oxides (e.g., TiO2) increases the activity at lower temperatures, hence they are used personally, e.g., H2."

            "description": "Co3O4 is active for CO oxidation especially in combination with Fe2O3; but is pursued by H2. A recent study (I.C., 47, 33-47 (1977)) points to controlled oxidation, which oxidizes CO with high productivity. On the note of the 50% conversion.",
