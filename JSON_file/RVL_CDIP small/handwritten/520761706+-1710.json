        "body": "This is to inform you that I was taken to the hospital with only 3% breathing capacity. There was indeed no oxygenation. The diagnosis was emphysema after 46 years of smoking your product, which has been Winston's. I am very close to dying, in the same manner as my father and grandfather who were also smokers. At the time we all smoked there were no warnings that cigarettes contained poisonous compounds of any type. All the information above has also been mailed to the American Cancer Society and The Attorney General of Florida. During my experience in the hospital, I noticed long term smokers dying daily from smoking, with no other apparent health problems, except for your contributing product. As an American citizen I have taken the liberty of assigning the law firm of Roer and Lawyers of Tampa, Florida who will be following the matter of this life and death case very closely, as all this information is in regards to myself during my degrees of dying. I will be following up with over 3,000 names of smokers that are sick and dying as I am from your product.",
