Auid ing assay suggests that the Aeuphssiteein brain pre proteinaceous. Additional inhibition binding experiments were conducted to expand the pharmacological profile of muistrins peptide subsites in the rat brain. Koslin, a known muistrinic agonist, inhibited 3H-nicotine binding by 50% at around 1 \u00b5M, giving a calculated inhibition constant (Ki) of 1 nM. The stereospecificity of the sites was also confirmed. The IC50 for nicotine was 0.1 \u00b5M, giving a Ki of 0.05 \u00b5M. Therefore, the D-isomer is about 60-fold more effective than the L-isomer in displacing the nicotine from the binding sites.",
