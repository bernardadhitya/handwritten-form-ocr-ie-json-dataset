You continue to present as collected authorities who maintain there is no conclusive evidence that cigarettes cause lung cancer. And now in light of some smoking rights, (i.e. San Francisco) you are running a campaign to educate or is it manipulate the public. By the way, it's ironic government subsidies and suppresses hard times. For as I'm concerned you are everything I say cancer. You want something you are smelling, or there is from a possible smoke trade. Yet we when in reality we are the majority."
