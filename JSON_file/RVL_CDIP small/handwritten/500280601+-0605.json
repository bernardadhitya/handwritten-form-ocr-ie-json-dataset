    "abstract": "It has become more and more clear that nicotine is being studied by the AsFC. This part will aim to clear up unresolved questions in animal and human experiments, which must be complementary in the future.",
    "general_pharmacology": {
        "nicotine_effects": "Nicotine acts directly on the acetylcholine system, influencing not only memory and concentration but also other systems affecting general reactivity, emotion, and functions such as hunger and thirst."

    "animal_experiments": {
        "funding": "AsFC",
        "findings": "The effects of nicotine injection can be simulated by smoke inhalation, provided other substances play only a marginal role in the psychological effects. The effects of nicotine depend on the conditions of the test subject at the moment. An excited animal may become more sedated and a calm animal more stimulated."

    "subjective_changes": "The subjective changes in conditions caused by nicotine are significant."
