    "message": "Just wanted to write a little thank you note for your great product, Camel cigarettes. I recently switched brands from Marlboro to Camel Lights and have found better taste, service, and usually better prices. I was raised on a farm and realize how the FDA can make good prices hard to do for the cigarette industry today. Keep up the good work. And if you ever need a good supervisor for one of your factories, I'm willing to relocate. Once again, thank you and keep up the good work.",
