Your ad dehumanization and domination of women, but most importantly, it blatantly condones violent treatment of women. In a society in which one of every three women is eighteen years old, people do not need any more exposure to ads and attitudes explicitly. I am not going to support your corporation in any way, including Nabisco products and Camel cigarettes.",
