    "body": "Dear Mr. Reynolds, I am a student at Queensbury Middle School and am in the eighth grade. I would like to ask you some questions, so if you do decide to answer this letter, don't expect to get a second-grade answer. The reason that I'm writing is my health teacher and I were to choose two final projects, one of which is a letter to a company, magazine, etc., regarding health of humans. But now back to the questions. I was wondering if you yourself smoke? Why did you make this decision? To pry into your personal life, how do you feel about your son and his protest against the tobacco industry? Do you feel guilty that every day due to the product that you produce, people die in the masses? Personally, I hope that you do feel guilty because you are probably a part of that statistic.",
