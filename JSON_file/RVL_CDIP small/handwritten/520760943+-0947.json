    "message": "I am a loyal friend and smoker. I smoke Doral menthols. I am 41 years old. I have been smoking 20 years, I smoke 4 cartons a month. I enjoy smoking. I have practically made a religion out of it! With all of these people unfairly suing, I am a loyal smoker and friend. Why should they get all the money? I have a wife and 10-year-old child. We don't have much money, we both are disabled. Not because of smoking, my wife doesn't even smoke. She was a W.A.C.K."
