    "body": "I have smoked Doral Full Flavors for many years and have really enjoyed the taste and flavor of them. I live on Social Security and I get paid once a month, so I buy 5 cartons a month. I keep them in the freezer so that they stay good and fresh. Here in the past 3 months, I've bought my Dorals and they've been stale. I light one up and it's burned out before I know it. At first, I thought it was where I bought them. I bought 5 cartons at Krogers in Mt. Gilead, then bought cartons at Geyer's Super Value in Mt. Gilead, then this past month I bought 5 cartons at Dino's Drive Thru in Marion and they've all been stale and burn up fast. I just wanted to know if the quality went down while the price went up. I even pack my cigarettes.",
