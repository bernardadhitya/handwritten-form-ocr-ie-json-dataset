I'm asking if you could make a travel bag for Salem smoker. Called the 800-433-8000 number and requested this also. I have smoked Salems for 35 years and have sent proofs of Salem packs for your free green Salem bag. If you would, you'd see what I mean. I could send as many coupons as needed. I have them saved.
