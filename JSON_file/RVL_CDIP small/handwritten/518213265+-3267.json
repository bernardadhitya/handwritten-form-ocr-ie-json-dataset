My last carton, I'm not sure why, but in at least seven packs that I have opened, the cigarettes have only been half full of tobacco. You may check with the Camel cash program that I am definitely a faithful buyer. I truly believe that this carton should be replaced or some form of compensation made. I trust you will agree. Thank you.",
