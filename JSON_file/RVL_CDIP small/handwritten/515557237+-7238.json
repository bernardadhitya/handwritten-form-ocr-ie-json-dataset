    "issue": "In late '96 or early '97, I sent in the required number of Doral Pack Seals to obtain an item from a Doral Catalogue. The item I ordered, Barska Binoculars, was depleted from your stock at 25 Doral Pack Seals. The expiration date of the voucher is February. I was hesitant to use this voucher for free cartons due to a statement on the voucher indicating 'No partial credits will be returned for orders of a lesser value' as well as free carton offers were/are limited to one carton per order. The resultant use of the voucher for a carton of cigarettes would have left me with an effective deficit of 189 pack seals.",
    "request": "Along with a recent merchandise catalogue (the soon to be expired voucher in my possession would be returned to you, of course) or to accept the voucher, valued at 25 pack seals, and send me four cartons of Doral Full. Implement an alternative option.",
    "closing": "Thank you for your attention in this matter.",
