    "title": "A FAIR DEAL",
    "guarantee": "No matter how much of the Eclipse trial carton you smoke, you have our guarantee from the first pack in this carton to the last. So whatever you decide, it won't be at your expense.",
    "request": "All we ask is that you give Eclipse a good, fair try. A full week. The whole carton. A trial period that leaves you sure you've made the right call. Because Eclipse really is a better way to smoke whether you're concerned about secondhand smoke or many of the other issues you and other smokers face today.",
    "refund_policy": "That's our deal. If you feel that after giving Eclipse a good, fair try Eclipse is not right for you, simply call 1-800-708-7878 and we'll refund the full cost of your first carton of Eclipse. If you don't mind, we'd also like to briefly ask you about your experience with Eclipse.",
