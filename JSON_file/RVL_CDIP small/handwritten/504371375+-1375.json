    "Body": "A study of the effect of Part I filing value. Reduced tar and reduced Part I filling value increased tar in Winston KS cigarettes with the same brand but with four different filling values were made on a Hauni Baby in the cigarette fabrication factory. Selected by weight and draft, and submitted for FTC Tar Analysis. The study showed that Part I filling value affected the tar content of the low-tar cigarettes studied. Brands and cigarettes made in-house are needed to quantify the effect.",
