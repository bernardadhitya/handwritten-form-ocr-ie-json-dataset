    "body": "I recently purchased a box of Salem Slim Light 100's. I am writing to you today to inquire about what I found when I opened the package. I have smoked this brand for quite a few years. When I opened the box to retrieve one of the smokes I noticed that there was one cigarette that had an emerald green filter. It was the same length as the others and looked identical except for the filter. I simply am curious as to why this was in there. Am I the lucky winner of the green filter contest? Is this a quality control issue? Was there a different Salem brand that does have green filters that was somehow packaged with the Salem Light 100s? I am wondering how and why this happened and if it is a packaging error then wanted to bring it to your attention. I still do have it. Cigarettes are costly enough - I don't need to get 19 instead of 20 for my money! I look forward to your reply. Thank you.",
