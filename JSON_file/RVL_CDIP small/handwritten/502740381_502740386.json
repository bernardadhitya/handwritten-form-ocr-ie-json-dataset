Some aspects can only be measured by a comprehensive study of smoking behavior, which may allow certain conclusions on compensation. Part of the study and more recent studies on the growth of compensation are short-term studies conducted with a relatively small number of subjects. These differ from commercial cigarettes not only in nicotine amount but also in other smoke components. Studies talk about the grounds of compensation, the problem of compensation lies in being classified while planning information about nicotine uptake in relation to cigarette brand and smoker type."
