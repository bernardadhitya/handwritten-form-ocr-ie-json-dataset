        "content": "Contains tiny amounts of tars and nicotine. Tars take form of the tobacco dune, more coal, the loop and then the exhalation. Cleaning cloths in the lungs and bronchial tubes cannot brush out germs and dust as they should. Nicotine is a drug contained in tobacco leaves. It makes the heart beat faster and also affects your breathing. Nicotine can cause cancer, injure the heart, and cause diseases such as lung cancer, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. The nicotine in tobacco, although dangerous in large quantities, is present."
