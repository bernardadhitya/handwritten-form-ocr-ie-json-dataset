I retired this past February. Most of us have been together for at least 25 of those years while looking through your new items that I would like to get for us. I would like to ask if I know of any one item or both. I am not sure of what they are yet. They are: LKHANICAMCL CAP#QO580 at $9 each, Q.CufOJos Coffee Cup #JOOQOA7 at $7 each. Most of us wear hats and for only $8.46. I have to be honest with you, not all of us are smokers, some cigars, but we all like these Joe Carts items."
