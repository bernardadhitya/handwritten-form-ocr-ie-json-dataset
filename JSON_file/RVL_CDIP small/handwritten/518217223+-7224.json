    "letter": "Dear Sir, I have been smoking Dorals for a long time, and never have had a complaint until now. I bought ten cartons of cigarettes to smoke three packs, the tobacco out of the papers. I tried to return to the company. I will continue to smoke Dorals, I wanted you to know what happened to me. Sincerely, Linda Harper",
