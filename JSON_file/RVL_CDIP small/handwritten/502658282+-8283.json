        "content": "You had better pull my letter idea out of your files, as the government is pushing for a cigarette that puts itself out. That's done. Do not spot on your cigarettes or letters. Safety line. Sirs, I have an idea for your R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. I suggest you make your Salem Lite 100's. If you would, can put a dead spot in your cigarettes, especially for filter cigarettes, that would put itself out when you smoke down to that point. Also, it would be less tar and nicotine. Now you can just make the filter longer. The public won't buy it. They just say we're not buying a long filter with little tobacco in it. But, if you say, not a dead spot, that would it be, in fact, but, say a safety spot, people will go for that. You would have to mention safety spot in your ads. Stress that point. The policy has been warned not to carry from smoking. So anything you mention about a safer cigarette, the public will run to that product. Cigarettes, yours, and it would also be a safe feature for people who fall asleep with cigarette in hand, and people on medication same; older people etc. Like I mentioned, I smoke, Salem Lite 100's when I smoke down to the filter part, ignites into a flame. This change would enlist. Smoke the cigarette down to the safety spot, you fall asleep, the cigarette has to go out. With your ad people, keep on TV mags, stressing the safety factor, with no less in tobacco taste. You have to also have to stress this part in your ads. The idea is, say this is my suggestion."
