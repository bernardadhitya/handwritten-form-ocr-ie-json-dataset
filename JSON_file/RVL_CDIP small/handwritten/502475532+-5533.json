        "content": "I am a faithful smoker of your new cigarette, Salem Lights. Being a previous smoker of Salem regular, I changed because of the lower tar and nicotine content. But, as I opened a new pack of Lights, I lit up one, and the draw was very light. I noticed the filter tip was fastened unsecurely, allowing air through the passage. Thinking nothing of this, I tried another one, but to my dismay, same way. I am writing to your department, for there was a third one also in the pack.",
