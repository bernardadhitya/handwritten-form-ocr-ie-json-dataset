I am 45 years old and smoke 2 packs a day since I was 18. My 13-year-old niece lives with me and she has bronchial problems. She coughs a lot when she is around me smoking. If this smokeless cigarette really works, she would be one person to benefit from it and I could continue smoking without worrying about her health. My brother also smokes a lot and when he and I are smoking at the same time, my niece is getting a double dose of second-hand smoke. If you would consider test marketing in my area, I could get you at least 25 other people to also participate, most of them with children in the home. And as you have probably guessed by now, cigarettes are expensive and most of us are looking for alternatives."
