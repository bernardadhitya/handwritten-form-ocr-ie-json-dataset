    "message": "A note to tell you how I feel about your Camel Ads. I feel they are degrading to women. So much so that I have stopped buying Nabisco products. As much as I like a Keebler substitute, I had decided this after finding that Nabisco was owned by RJR, because as a non-smoker I decided my vote against Camel would carry no weight. Then I saw the enclosed article in the Oregonian. Evidently, I'm not the only one incensed."
