I have all the scientific knowledge concerning illness and death caused by smoking cigarettes. I was diagnosed with throat cancer, had surgery to remove the tumor, and went through a long, agonizing, and debilitating treatment. My doctors are most positive that if I had only known so many years ago what I know today, I never would have lit that first cigarette. Now we are all becoming quite aware of the true unforgivable hazards of smoking cigarettes. I feel that $300,000.00 compensation for all the discomfort, pain, and medical bills is well within reason. If my request is not met, I am prepared to file a suit against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. If lawyers become involved, the amount will be astronomical.",
