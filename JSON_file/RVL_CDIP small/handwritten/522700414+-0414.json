    "message": "Thank you for contacting us. You wrote on your comment card that you had purchased Nicoderm patches. We believe this means you intend to quit, or have quit smoking. We respect your decision to quit smoking. In fact, the number of Americans who have quit smoking is nearly as large as the number who currently smoke. The 1990 U.S. Surgeon General's report stated that nearly 45 million Americans had quit smoking, most of them without outside help. For those smokers who want assistance in quitting, there are many products and programs available today. If you want to quit smoking, the first step we would suggest is talking with your doctor, or calling the local chapter of the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, or the American Heart Association.",
