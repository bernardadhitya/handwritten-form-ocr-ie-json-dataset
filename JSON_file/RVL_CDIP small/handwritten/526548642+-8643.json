    "message": "As a pack a day smoker for 30 years, I am outraged at the increased cost of your cigarettes. For years, you sent coupons which helped with these costs, but no more. It's been over 3 years since I got any coupon for my Now Menthols, which I have been smoking since they first came on the market. I do not want coupons as I can use them now. We managed to get a monthly delivery of 5 cartons through a discount house, but still $30 per carton. It's $5 per cigarette locally if I ran out because delivery was late. I've had to pay $5 per pack when I could locate my brand. I will not smoke any other brand, period, as I will go quite a distance to find them. At $5 per pack, that's quite a bit per cigarette. Don't you people think that's a little outrageous? I never took part in any lawsuits against tobacco or do believe them to have merit. I choose to smoke and no one has ever forced it upon me, not tobacco companies nor anyone else. I make that choice. I get sick, my own fault, not yours. So why is it that a good faithful customer must go to the 'poor house' to enjoy a lifelong pleasantry? Think about it. Seems a little unfair to me. Is there an answer?",
