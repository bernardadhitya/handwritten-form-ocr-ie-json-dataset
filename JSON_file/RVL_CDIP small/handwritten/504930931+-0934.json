        "description": "Measurements relating to ETS in airline cabins. This study is the one conducted jointly by the FAA and the DHEW in 1977 and reported in 1971.",
        "results": {
            "discussion": "In discussing the results of the FAA/DHEW Study, Ramstrim concludes (on p. 6) that the samples were biased low owing to the overhead baggage racks.",
            "conclusion": "He bases his conclusion on the facts that (a) the rack serves as a barrier to airflow between the sampling point and the passenger receptors and (b) the airstreams extend from these factors; instead, he states measured particulate matter was quite low."
        },
        "hypothesis": "Ramstrim hypothesizes that the existence of the mentioned low bias is apparent and provided counteraction to certain aspects of the microclimate unique to aircraft cabins, causing discomfort perceived by passengers."
