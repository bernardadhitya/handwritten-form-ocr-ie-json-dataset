I could tell which one was the smoker's lung because it was black and the other was pink and healthy. Can I ask you a few questions? Why do you sell products that release harmful gases like carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrous oxides? Why advertise cigarettes and make smoking look fun? What do you do with the money? I am curious and looking for answers. But I am very concerned.",
