    "summary": "Among various sequences of sensors, simultaneously low levels of both glycol and glycerin results in the optimization of nearly all of the significant attributes in this specific combination. This combination of humectants increases taste, natural taste, fresh aftertaste, and ease of aftertaste and mildness. Furthermore, both measure relatively high in this region of humectants. Note the trade-offs associated with key attributes of acceptance measures. This optimal area of humectants is noted. Measures of optimization only dry aftertaste are advised. The results of the action conducted on samples were not as consistent as those of the initial test. Considering the trade-offs associated with each area of concern, other simultaneous combinations of glycol and glycerin result in relatively good performance. Suggested inclusively affects sweet aftertaste.",
