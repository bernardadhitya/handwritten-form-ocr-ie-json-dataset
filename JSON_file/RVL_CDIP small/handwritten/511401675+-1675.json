The proposed regulations and future restrictions are certain to follow in the near future, which are sure to cripple the industry and threaten my job. My livelihood as well as that of my family and community are certainly at risk because of such proposals requiring the issue of underage smoking with a better regulating city and jobs to not address these issues."
