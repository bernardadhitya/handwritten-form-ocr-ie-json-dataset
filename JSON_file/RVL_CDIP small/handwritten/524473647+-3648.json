    "message": "Dear sir/madam, This is my second attempt to be included as your customer. I believe the original form which I filled out and mailed to you did indicate that an Access card provides valid identification. I've since received an updated PA Access EBT card, a photocopy of which is enclosed. Also enclosed is a photocopy of my birth certificate. I am extremely handicapped and cannot get to the place where non-driving handicapped people go to get their PA IDs. You've persuaded me to switch to Dorai su J. I hope I've persuaded you that I'm 49 years old! This is the best I can do and have been waiting for my savings coupons. I am assured that I'm on your mailing list. Thank you for your time and interest in your customers.",
