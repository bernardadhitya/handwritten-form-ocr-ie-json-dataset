    "Subject": "Unun Carbide Co Reduction Material",
    "Summary": "Two different samples (403-90A and 403-90B) of union carbide materials were received and evaluated for possible activity in reducing the Co level in cigarette smoke. The material was placed in the filler portion of cigarettes in 200 mg, 100 mg, and 500 mg quantities. The cigarettes were smoked and analyzed for Co, FTC tar, nicotine, and H2O both before and after burning. Additionally, the Co smoke content was analyzed on a puff by puff basis both before and after humidification. The results of the analyses showed no significant reduction in Co in the cigarettes containing the union carbide materials over the control cigarettes.",
    "Experimental": "The two union carbide materials were received in the form of 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch cylindrical pellets. Sample 403-90A was blue in color while sample 403-90B was a pale tan."
