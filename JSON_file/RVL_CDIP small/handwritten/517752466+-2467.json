    "message": "Months ago I sent you over 300 pack seals and ordered two items from your merchandise gift catalog. I received one of the gifts but not the other which was a camera, I think, which you said was out of stock. You enclosed a certificate good for 259 seals which you said I could use. But you did not enclose a catalog of available prizes so the certificate was no good to me without something I could use it for. I eventually talked to someone from your company on the phone. I was told that a new catalog of gifts would be sent to me. They also said that new catalogs were available at most outlets that sold Dorals but I couldn't find a store that had them. And I received nothing in the mail. All you ever mailed me since was stuff I could use to send in more pack seals for cartons of cigarettes! I like Dorals but, frankly, I can't tell much difference between them. The main reason I buy Dorals is to save the pack seals to send in for merchandise prizes. But you are certainly making it hard for me to do this. If you don't do something about this soon I'm going to forget about Dorals and start smoking generics.",
