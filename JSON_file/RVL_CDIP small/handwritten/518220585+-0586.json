    "message": "I have been a customer of your product since I started smoking. I used to smoke Salem, and when the government and the state of West Virginia put all those taxes on cigarettes, I changed to a cheaper brand, which was Alpine, until R.J. came out with DoReL and I started buying it. Now I find out that all these proofs of purchase seals are no good and there are 775 seals I have been saving. Your company has not come out with anything but a free carton. Could you please make it right and do something for these proofs of purchase seals I'm sending you.",
