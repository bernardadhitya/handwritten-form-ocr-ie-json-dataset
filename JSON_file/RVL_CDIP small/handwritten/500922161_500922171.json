            "comment": "A low sidestream cigarette could help the situation but would not eliminate the problem completely. Perhaps, the design and distribution of a 'quiet' electronic ashtray which would remove much of the smoke and odor would be helpful. Fundamental investigation of the factors and mechanisms responsible for ashtray and residual smoke odors might suggest alternatives."

            "comment": "The Industry effort to do research on the passive smoking issue (Battelle Project) should be speeded up as fast as possible. If the Industry effort fails to move forward at a faster pace, then R&D should recommend a unilateral approach to getting the data necessary to deal with the passive smoking issue. Work in this area has the greatest chance of changing the current negative opinion of the smoker and the Industry."
