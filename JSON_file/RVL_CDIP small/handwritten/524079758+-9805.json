        "content": "From reading a book about all kinds of drugs, I learned that nicotine is responsible for the addictiveness of smoking. I've also seen what lungs look like with nicotine and tar in them. I thought it was really gross. When my science teacher showed me the difference between clean lungs and lungs filled with nicotine and tar, I was really turned off! Besides having black lungs, nicotine is very poisonous and taken alone a tiny drop can cause death to a human being. Do you think that you can not die from smoking and secondhand smoke? Well, it has happened. Why do you work for a 524079758? Do you smoke or use any type of drug? I am sincere about hearing from you.",
