It seems to me that it would be very hard to live with oneself if you knew this overpowering fact. I think that with this in mind, it would be very hard to publish ads which are not actually the truth. For instance, you show a younger man smoking. I know very well that it's not with all the tar and nicotine you put in cigarettes. I would appreciate an answer.",
