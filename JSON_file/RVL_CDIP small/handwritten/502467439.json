When 'Now' came out, I tried them and liked them because I could still see a difference between 'Now' and 'Carlton'. Then you came out with 'Now' with 1mg tar and 0.1mg nicotine. Well, this really set me because I figured you can't get much lower than this, and I have been smoking them since. But just recently, I have been buying them by the single pack and also by the carton, and none of the boxes are marked 1mg tar and 0.1mg nicotine. All that I can purchase now is 2mg tar and 0.2mg of nicotine, or every once in a while a pack will say 'Ultra Low Tar'. I hope you are not going downhill with a product I have enjoyed. If you could give me an explanation of how this change came about, whether through new testing and research revealing higher levels of tar and nicotine or some other reason, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much from a concerned consumer that has been satisfied with your product.",
